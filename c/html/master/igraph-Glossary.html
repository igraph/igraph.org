    This glossary defines common terms used throughout the igraph
    documentation.
  </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>attribute</strong></span>: A piece of data
        associated with a vertex, an edge, or the graph itself. The
        igraph C library currently supports numeric, string and Boolean
        attribute values, and provides a means for implementing
        attribute handlers that support custom types.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>adjacent</strong></span>: Two vertices are
        called <span class="strong"><strong>adjacent</strong></span> if there is
        an edge connecting them. This term describes a vertex-to-vertex
        relation.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>adjacency list</strong></span>: A data
        structure that associates a list of neighbours (i.e. adjacent
        vertices) to each vertex.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>adjacency matrix</strong></span>: A
        representation of a graph as a square matrix.
        <code class="literal">A_ij</code> gives the number of edge endpoints
        connecting from the <code class="literal">i</code>th vertex to the
        <code class="literal">j</code>th vertex. Conventionally, the diagonal of
        the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph contains
        <span class="emphasis"><em>twice</em></span> the number of self-loops. All igraph
        functions follow this convention unless noted otherwise.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>biadjacency matrix</strong></span>: Analogous
        to the adjacency matrix, but used for bipartite graphs. Element
        <code class="literal">B_ij</code> gives the number of edges from the
        <code class="literal">i</code>th vertex of the first group to the
        <code class="literal">j</code>th vertex of the second group.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>bipartite graph</strong></span>: A graph
        whose vertices can be partitioned into two groups in such a way
        that connections are present only between members of different
        groups.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>complete graph</strong></span>: Also called
        <span class="strong"><strong>full graph</strong></span> within the context
        of igraph, a graph in which all pairs of vertices are connected
        to each other.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>connected graph</strong></span>: A connected
        graph consists of a single component, in which any vertex is
        reachable from any other. In igraph, the null graph is not
        considered connected, as it has not one, but zero components.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>edge</strong></span>: A
        <span class="strong"><strong>connection</strong></span> between two
        vertices, also called a <span class="strong"><strong>link</strong></span>.
        In igraph, edges are referred to by integer indices called
        <span class="strong"><strong>edge IDs</strong></span>.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>finalizer stack</strong></span>: A global
        stack used internally by igraph to keep track of currently
        allocated objects and their destructors, so that they can be
        automatically destroyed in case of an error.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>game</strong></span>: Within igraph, this
        term is used for stochastic graph generators, i.e. functions
        that sample from random graph models.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>graph</strong></span> or
        <span class="strong"><strong>network</strong></span>: A set of vertices
        with connections between them. In igraph, graphs may carry
        associated data in the form of vertex, edge or graph attributes.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>incident</strong></span>: An edge is called
        <span class="strong"><strong>incident</strong></span> to the vertices that
        are its endpoints. This term describes a vertex-to-edge
        relation.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>incidence list</strong></span>: A data
        structure that associates a list of incident edges to each
        vertex.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>incidence matrix</strong></span>: A matrix
        describing the incidence relation between vertices (rows) and
        edges (columns).
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>membership vector</strong></span>: Membership
        vectors are a means of encoding a partitioning of items, usually
        vertices, into several groups. The <code class="literal">i</code>th
        element of the vector gives an integer identifier of the group
        the <code class="literal">i</code>th vertex belongs to. Membership vectors
        are typically used to describe a vertex clustering obtained
        through community detection, or by identifying the connected
        components of a graph.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>multi-edges</strong></span> or
        <span class="strong"><strong>parallel edges</strong></span>: More than one
        edge connecting the same two vertices. In a directed graph,
        <code class="literal">a -&gt; b, a -&gt; b</code> are considered parallel
        edges, but <code class="literal">a -&gt; b, a &lt;- b</code> are not.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>null graph</strong></span>: A graph with no
        vertices (and no edges).
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>self-loop</strong></span>,
        <span class="strong"><strong>self-edge</strong></span>, or simply
        <span class="strong"><strong>loop</strong></span>: An edge that connects a
        vertex to itself.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>simple graph</strong></span>: A graph that
        does not have self-loops or multi-edges.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>singleton graph</strong></span>: A graph
        having a single vertex. This term usually refers to a single
        vertex with no edges, but note that self-loops may in principle
        be present.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>vertex</strong></span>: Graphs consist of
        vertices, also called <span class="strong"><strong>nodes</strong></span>,
        that are connected to each other. In igraph, vertices are
        referred to by integer indices called
        <span class="strong"><strong>vertex IDs</strong></span>.
