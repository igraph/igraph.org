        <h1>igraph Code of Conduct</h1>
      </div>
      <h2><span id="introduction" class="anchor">&nbsp;</span>
        Introduction</h2>
      <p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the igraph project,
        including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs,
        Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our community. Any events related to our
        community shall also be bound by this code of conduct or a very similar variant thereof.</p>
      <p>This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in
        the igraph community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the
        project, in any project-related activities, and, especially, when representing the
        project, in any capacity.</p>
      <p>This code of conduct is neither exhaustive nor complete. It serves to distill our common
        understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to
        follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and
        productive environment that enriches the surrounding community.</p>

      <h2><span id="specific-guidelines" class="anchor">&nbsp;</span>
        Specific guidelines
      </h2>
      <p>We strive to:</p>
      <ol class="arabic simple">
        <li>
          <p>Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use
            public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless
            discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or
            project-related support, too; not only is a public-support request much more
            likely to result in an answer to a question, it also ensures that any
            inadvertent mistakes in answering are more easily detected and corrected.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve
            conflict, and assume good intentions. We may all experience some frustration
            from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal
            attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
            productive one.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will
            depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the
            project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can
            build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect
            users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making
            decisions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many
            problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may direct them to
            the appropriate forum. We will try hard to be responsive and helpful.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Be careful in the words that we choose. We are careful and respectful in
            our communication and we take responsibility for our own words. Be kind to
            others. Do not insult or put down other participants. We do not tolerate
            harassment or other exclusionary behavior, such as:
          </p>
          <ul class="simple">
            <li>
              <p>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly,
                or unlogged forums, such as IRC channel history, without the sender’s consent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Excessive profanity. Please avoid swearwords; people differ greatly in their sensitivity to swearing.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2><span id="diversity-statement" class="anchor">&nbsp;</span>
        Diversity statement
      </h2>
      <p>The igraph project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are
        committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although
        we may not always be able to accommodate each individual’s preferences, we try
        our best to treat everyone kindly.</p>
      <p>No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
        Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honor diversity in:
        age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language,
        national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race,
        religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical
        ability, to the extent that these do not conflict with this code of conduct.</p>
      <p>Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, igraph development is
        conducted in English.</p>
      <p>Standards for behavior in the igraph community are detailed in the Code of
        Conduct above. Participants in our community should uphold these standards
        in all their interactions and help others to do so as well (see next section).</p>

      <h2><span id="reporting-guidelines" class="anchor">&nbsp;</span>
        Reporting guidelines</h2>
      <p>We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start at or
        devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We also recognize that sometimes
        people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the guidelines in this Code
        of Conduct. Please keep this in mind when deciding on how to respond to a
        breach of this Code.</p>
      <p>For clearly flagrant breaches, report those to the igraph organisation
        (see below). For possibly unintentional breaches, you may reply to the person
        and point out this Code of Conduct (either in public or in private, whatever is
        most appropriate). If you would prefer not to do that, please feel free to
        report to the igraph organisation directly, or ask the organisation for
        advice, in confidence.</p>
      <p>You can report issues to the igraph organisation, at
        <a href="mailto:igraph@igraph.org">igraph@igraph.org</a>.
        Currently, the following persons will receive your report </p>
      <ul class="simple">
        <li>
          <p>Gábor Csárdi</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Tamás Nepusz</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Szabolcs Horvát</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Vincent Traag</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your report involves any of the above mentioned persons, or if they feel they have
        a conflict of interest in handling it, they will recuse themselves from
        considering your report. Alternatively, if, for any reason, you feel
        uncomfortable making a report to the organisation directly, then you can also contact any of the above
        mentioned
        persons individually.</p>

      <h2><span id="incident-reporting" class="anchor">&nbsp;</span>
        Incident reporting
      </h2>
      <p>We will investigate and respond to all complaints. The igraph
        organisation will protect the identity of the reporter, and treat the content of complaints as confidential
        (unless the reporter agrees otherwise).</p>
      <p>In case of flagrant breaches, e.g., personal threats or violent, sexist
        or racist language, we will immediately disconnect the originator from igraph. In particular, the organisation
        will</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Immediately disconnect the originator from all igraph communication channels.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Revoke any granted permissions from the originator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Reply to the reporter that their report has been received and that the
            originator has been disconnected.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In every case, the moderator should make a reasonable effort to contact the
            originator, and tell them specifically how their language or actions
            qualify as a “flagrant breach”. The moderator should also say
            that, if the originator believes this is unfair or they want to be
            reconnected to igraph, they have the right to ask for a review, as below, by
            the igraph organisation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The igraph organisation will formally review and sign off on all cases
            where this mechanism has been applied to make sure it is not being used to
            control ordinary heated disagreement.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In cases not involving flagrant breaches of this code of
        conduct, the process for acting on any received code of conduct violation
        report will be:</p>

      <ol class="arabic simple">
        <li>
          <p>acknowledgement that the report has been received</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>reasonable discussion/feedback</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>mediation (if feedback didn’t help, and only if both reporter and reportee agree to this)</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The organisation will respond to any report as soon as possible, and at most
        within 5 working days.</p>

      <h2><span id="endnotes" class="anchor">&nbsp;</span>
        Endnotes</h2>
      <p>This Code of Conduct is inspired by
          <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html">The SciPy Code of
              Conduct</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The current organisation of the igraph community is rudimentary. A more professional organisation may develop
        in
        the future, at which point the procedure of handling incident reports will also be further formalized.</p>
