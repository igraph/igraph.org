[C/igraph](https://igraph.org/c/) 0.10.10, the ninth bugfix release of the 0.10 series, has arrived.

The source can be obtained from [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.10.10).

This is primarily a maintenance release with bug fixes, in particular a caching issue in `igraph_is_forest()`.

Read on for more details about the changes in version 0.10.10.

### Fixed

 - When `igraph_is_forest()` determined that a graph is not a directed forest, and the `roots` output parameter was set to `NULL`, it would incorrectly cache that the graph is also not an undirected forest.
 - `igraph_spanner()` now correctly ignores edge directions, and no longer crashes on directed graphs.

### Deprecated

 - `igraph_are_connected()` is renamed to `igraph_are_adjacent()`; the old name is kept available until at least igraph 1.0.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.
