[C/igraph](https://igraph.org/c/) 0.10.6, the fifth bugfix release of the 0.10 series, has arrived.

The source can be obtained from [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.10.6).

This is a maintenance release bringing bug fixes only. In particular, we fixed convergence failures in `igraph_community_voronoi()` in certain cases on certain platforms, and ensured compatibility with libxml2 2.11.

Read on for more details about the changes in version 0.10.6.

### Fixed

 - Compatibility with libxml2 2.11.
 - Fixed some converge failures in `igraph_community_voronoi()`.
 - `IGRAPH_CALLOC()` and `IGRAPH_REALLOC()` now check for overflow.
 - CMake packages created with the `install` target of the CMake build system are now relocatable, i.e. the generated `igraph-targets.cmake` file does not contain absolute paths any more.
