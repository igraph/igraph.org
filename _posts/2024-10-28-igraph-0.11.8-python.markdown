[python-igraph](https://python.igraph.org/en/0.11.8/) 0.11.8, the seventh bugfix release of the 0.11 series, has arrived. The primary reason for this release is to update the C core of igraph to 0.10.14, which brings a few bugfixes and also a few new functions to the Python interface. This release also adds support for Python 3.13. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/releases/tag/0.11.8) for more details.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing `pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the source code are also available from the [Python Package Index page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.11.8/).

Read on for more details about the changes in version 0.11.8.
