[python-igraph](https://python.igraph.org/en/0.10.8/) 0.10.8, the seventh bugfix release of the 0.10 series, has arrived. This release updates the C core of igraph to 0.10.7, and adds support for weighted eccentricity and radius calculations. There are also some minor additions and improvements; please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/releases/tag/0.10.8) for more details.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing `pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the source code are also available from the [Python Package Index page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.10.8/).
