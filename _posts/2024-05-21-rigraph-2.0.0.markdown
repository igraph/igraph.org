We're thrilled to announce that igraph 2.0 has been released!
In this post, we highlight the most important changes.

# The R package is now in sync with the C core

This major release brings development in line with [the igraph C library](https://igraph.org/c/).
Version 1.6.0 of the R package used version 0.9.10 of the C core. 
The changes in the 0.10 series of the C core are now taken up in version 2.0 of the R package. 
Having the R package use the latest version of the C core was a huge undertaking, and is a great milestone which makes the many improvements from version 0.10 of the C core available to R users.

Improvements made in the C core will be made available more easily in
functions in the R package. 
See the [complete changelog](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/blob/main/src/vendor/cigraph/CHANGELOG.md) of the C core. 
While we tried to maintain compatibility with version 1.6.0 of the R interface, it wasn't always possible. 
Refer to the "Breaking changes" sections in the changelog of the R package
([breaking changes section](https://r.igraph.org/news/index.html#breaking-changes-2-0-0)).
If you maintain a package that depends on igraph, you may have heard from us.

The move to version 0.10 of C/igraph brings many quality improvements,
including support for graphs with billions of vertices and edges on 64-bit computers, much more stringent error checking, 
as well as lots of improvements to robustness, reliability and mathematical consistency
across functions.

Future work will aim at further automating the generation of R code from C code, making improved C core functionality more quickly available to R users. 
Additionally, we plan to expose more C core functions, since not all functions are available to R users just yet.

# Improvements to the documentation

The igraph R package now has a [website](https://r.igraph.org/), generated with the popular pkgdown R package, that is to say, a website that has a predictable structure and that includes a search functionality. 
The website now features an introductory vignette contributed by [Adrian Diaz](https://github.com/adriandiazlab) and Fabio Zanini in both [English](https://r.igraph.org/articles/igraph.html) and [Spanish](https://r.igraph.org/articles/igraph_ES.html).

# Towards a more explicit lifecycle

We are in the middle of efforts aimed at making the lifecycle of functions more explicit so that you might know what function is deprecated, and which function is more experimental. 
For instance, we will slowly be removing most ["dotted-names functions"](https://r.igraph.org/articles/deprecated-dot-case.html),
like add.edges() that is now add_edges(), although both versions currently still work. 
The [`is_biconnected()`
function](https://r.igraph.org/reference/is_biconnected.html) is an example of an experimental function, that is to say, a C function that was just exposed.
