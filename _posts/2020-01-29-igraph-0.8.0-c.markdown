Release 0.8.0 of igraph's C core, coming almost five years after 0.7.1, is a major improvement with several new features, performance and robustness improvements, and many bug fixes. New functionality includes additional graph generators, functions for handling trees, new community detection methods, improved clique finding, spectral graph embedding, as well as several other features. Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/blob/0.8.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.

We would like to thank everyone who reported issues, contributed features or fixes, or edited the documentation. igraph is an open-source project run by volunteers. *As always, your contributions are very welcome!*

Most people use igraph through its high-level interfaces for [R](https://igraph.org/r/), [Python](https://igraph.org/python/) or [Mathematica](http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM). A new release of the Python interface, incorporating all these improvements, is expected to be released in a few weeks. The R and Mathematica interfaces already include some of the improvements, and will continue to integrate more.

Concurrently with the release of igraph 0.8, we are launching [a new community forum](https://igraph.discourse.group/), which will replace the mailing list as the main support channel. If you are a current igraph user or just interested in the project, please join!
