[python-igraph](https://python.igraph.org/en/0.11.5/) 0.11.5, the fifth bugfix release of the 0.11 series, has arrived. The primary reason for this release is to update the C core of igraph to 0.10.12, which brings quite a few bugfixes to the Python interface. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/releases/tag/0.11.5) for more details.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing `pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the source code are also available from the [Python Package Index page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.11.3/).

Read on for more details about the changes in version 0.11.5.

### Added

- Added a `prefixattr=...` keyword argument to `Graph.write_graphml()` that allows the user to strip the `g_`, `v_` and `e_` prefixes from GraphML files written by igraph.

### Changed

- `Graph.are_connected()` has now been renamed to `Graph.are_adjacent()`, following up a similar change in the C core. The old name of the function is deprecated but will be kept around until at least 0.12.0.
- The C core of igraph was updated to version 0.10.12.
- Deprecated `PyCObject` API calls in the C code were replaced by calls to `PyCapsule`, thanks to [@DavidRConnell](https://github.com/DavidRConnell) in [#763](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/pull/763)
- `get_shortest_path()` documentation was clarified by [@JDPowell648](https://github.com/JDPowell648) in [#764](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/pull/764)
- It is now possible to link to an existing igraph C core on MSYS2, thanks to [@Kreijstal](https://github.com/Kreijstal) in [#770](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/pull/770)

### Fixed

- Bugfix in the NetworkX graph conversion code by [@rmmaf](https://github.com/rmmaf) in [#767](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/pull/767)
