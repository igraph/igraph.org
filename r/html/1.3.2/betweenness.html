<h2>Vertex and edge betweenness centrality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The vertex and edge betweenness are (roughly) defined by the number of
geodesics (shortest paths) going through a vertex or an edge.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>estimate_betweenness(
  graph,
  vids = V(graph),
  directed = TRUE,
  cutoff,
  weights = NULL,
  nobigint = TRUE
)

betweenness(
  graph,
  v = V(graph),
  directed = TRUE,
  weights = NULL,
  nobigint = TRUE,
  normalized = FALSE,
  cutoff = -1
)

edge_betweenness(
  graph,
  e = E(graph),
  directed = TRUE,
  weights = NULL,
  cutoff = -1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The graph to analyze.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>vids</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vertices for which the vertex betweenness estimation will be
calculated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, whether directed paths should be considered while
determining the shortest paths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cutoff</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum path length to consider when calculating the
betweenness. If zero or negative then there is no such limit.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
betweenness. If the graph has a <code>weight</code> edge attribute, then this is
used by default. Weights are used to calculate weighted shortest paths,
so they are interpreted as distances.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nobigint</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to use big integers during the
calculation. Deprecated since igraph 1.3 and will be removed in igraph 1.4.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>v</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vertices for which the vertex betweenness will be calculated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>normalized</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to normalize the betweenness
scores. If <code>TRUE</code>, then the results are normalized by the number of ordered
or unordered vertex pairs in directed and undirected graphs, respectively.
In an undirected graph,            
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">B^n=\frac{2B}{(n-1)(n-2)},</code>
</p>
<p> where
<code class="reqn">B^n</code> is the normalized, <code class="reqn">B</code> the raw betweenness, and <code class="reqn">n</code>
is the number of vertices in the graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>e</code></td>
<td>
<p>The edges for which the edge betweenness will be calculated.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The vertex betweenness of vertex <code>v</code> is defined by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\sum_{i\ne j, i\ne v, j\ne v} g_{ivj}/g_{ij}</code>
</p>

<p>The edge betweenness of edge <code>e</code> is defined by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\sum_{i\ne j} g_{iej}/g_{ij}.</code>
</p>

<p><code>betweenness</code> calculates vertex betweenness, <code>edge_betweenness</code>
calculates edge betweenness.
</p>
<p>Here <code class="reqn">g_{ij}</code> is the total number of shortest paths between vertices
<code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code> while <code class="reqn">g_{ivj}</code> is the number of those shortest paths
which pass though vertex <code class="reqn">v</code>.
</p>
<p>Both functions allow you to consider only paths of length <code>cutoff</code> or
smaller; this can be run for larger graphs, as the running time is not
quadratic (if <code>cutoff</code> is small). If <code>cutoff</code> is zero or negative,
then the function calculates the exact betweenness scores. Using zero as a
cutoff is <em>deprecated</em> and future versions (from 1.4.0) will treat zero
cutoff literally (i.e. no paths considered at all). If you want no cutoff,
use a negative number.
</p>
<p><code>estimate_betweenness</code> and <code>estimate_edge_betweenness</code> are
aliases for <code>betweenness</code> and <code>edge_betweenness</code>, with a different
argument order, for sake of compatibility with older versions of igraph.
</p>
<p>For calculating the betweenness a similar algorithm to the one proposed by
Brandes (see References) is used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector with the betweenness score for each vertex in
<code>v</code> for <code>betweenness</code>.
</p>
<p>A numeric vector with the edge betweenness score for each edge in <code>e</code>
for <code>edge_betweenness</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>edge_betweenness</code> might give false values for graphs with
multiple edges.
