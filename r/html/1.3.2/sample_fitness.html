<h2>Random graphs from vertex fitness scores</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a non-growing random graph with edge probabilities
proportional to node fitness scores.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>sample_fitness(
  no.of.edges,
  fitness.out,
  fitness.in = NULL,
  loops = FALSE,
  multiple = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>no.of.edges</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of edges in the generated graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fitness.out</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector containing the fitness of each vertex.
For directed graphs, this specifies the out-fitness of each vertex.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fitness.in</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>NULL</code> (the default), the generated graph will be
undirected. If not <code>NULL</code>, then it should be a numeric vector and it
specifies the in-fitness of each vertex.
</p>
<p>If this argument is not <code>NULL</code>, then a directed graph is generated,
otherwise an undirected one.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>loops</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to allow loop edges in the graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multiple</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to allow multiple edges in the
graph.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This game generates a directed or undirected random graph where the
probability of an edge between vertices <code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code> depends on the
fitness scores of the two vertices involved. For undirected graphs, each
vertex has a single fitness score. For directed graphs, each vertex has an
out- and an in-fitness, and the probability of an edge from <code class="reqn">i</code> to
<code class="reqn">j</code> depends on the out-fitness of vertex <code class="reqn">i</code> and the in-fitness of
vertex <code class="reqn">j</code>.
</p>
<p>The generation process goes as follows. We start from <code class="reqn">N</code> disconnected
nodes (where <code class="reqn">N</code> is given by the length of the fitness vector). Then we
randomly select two vertices <code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code>, with probabilities
proportional to their fitnesses. (When the generated graph is directed,
<code class="reqn">i</code> is selected according to the out-fitnesses and <code class="reqn">j</code> is selected
according to the in-fitnesses). If the vertices are not connected yet (or if
multiple edges are allowed), we connect them; otherwise we select a new
pair. This is repeated until the desired number of links are created.
</p>
<p>It can be shown that the <em>expected</em> degree of each vertex will be
proportional to its fitness, although the actual, observed degree will not
be. If you need to generate a graph with an exact degree sequence, consider
<code><a href="sample_degseq.html">sample_degseq</a></code> instead.
</p>
<p>This model is commonly used to generate static scale-free networks. To
achieve this, you have to draw the fitness scores from the desired power-law
distribution. Alternatively, you may use <code><a href="sample_fitness_pl.html">sample_fitness_pl</a></code>
which generates the fitnesses for you with a given exponent.
</p>
