<h2>Reciprocity of graphs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the reciprocity of a directed graph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
reciprocity(graph, ignore.loops = TRUE, mode = c("default", "ratio"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The graph object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ignore.loops</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical constant, whether to ignore loop edges.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>See below.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The measure of reciprocity defines the proportion of mutual connections, in
a directed graph. It is most commonly defined as the probability that the
opposite counterpart of a directed edge is also included in the graph. Or in
adjacency matrix notation: <i>sum(i, j,
(A.*A')ij) / sum(i, j, Aij)</i>, where <i>A.*A'</i> is the
element-wise product of matrix <i>A</i> and its transpose. This measure is
calculated if the <code>mode</code> argument is <code>default</code>.
</p>
<p>Prior to igraph version 0.6, another measure was implemented, defined as the
probability of mutual connection between a vertex pair, if we know that
there is a (possibly non-mutual) connection between them. In other words,
(unordered) vertex pairs are classified into three groups: (1)
not-connected, (2) non-reciprocaly connected, (3) reciprocally connected.
The result is the size of group (3), divided by the sum of group sizes
(2)+(3). This measure is calculated if <code>mode</code> is <code>ratio</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric scalar between zero and one.
