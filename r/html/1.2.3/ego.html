<h2>Neighborhood of graph vertices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions find the vertices not farther than a given limit from
another fixed vertex, these are called the neighborhood of the vertex.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ego_size(graph, order = 1, nodes = V(graph), mode = c("all", "out",
  "in"), mindist = 0)

ego(graph, order = 1, nodes = V(graph), mode = c("all", "out", "in"),
  mindist = 0)

make_ego_graph(graph, order = 1, nodes = V(graph), mode = c("all",
  "out", "in"), mindist = 0)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer giving the order of the neighborhood.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vertices for which the calculation is performed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character constant, it specifies how to use the direction of
the edges if a directed graph is analyzed. For &lsquo;out&rsquo; only the
outgoing edges are followed, so all vertices reachable from the source
vertex in at most <code>order</code> steps are counted. For &lsquo;&quot;in&quot;&rsquo; all
vertices from which the source vertex is reachable in at most <code>order</code>
steps are counted. &lsquo;&quot;all&quot;&rsquo; ignores the direction of the edges. This
argument is ignored for undirected graphs.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mindist</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum distance to include the vertex in the result.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The neighborhood of a given order <code>o</code> of a vertex <code>v</code> includes all
vertices which are closer to <code>v</code> than the order. Ie. order 0 is always
<code>v</code> itself, order 1 is <code>v</code> plus its immediate neighbors, order 2
is order 1 plus the immediate neighbors of the vertices in order 1, etc.
</p>
<p><code>ego_size</code> calculates the size of the neighborhoods for the
given vertices with the given order.
</p>
<p><code>ego</code> calculates the neighborhoods of the given vertices with
the given order parameter.
</p>
<p><code>make_ego_graph</code> is creates (sub)graphs from all neighborhoods of
the given vertices with the given order parameter. This function preserves
the vertex, edge and graph attributes.
</p>
<p><code>connect</code> creates a new graph by connecting each vertex to
all other vertices in its neighborhood.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>ego_size</code> returns with an integer vector.
</p>
<p><code>ego</code> returns with a list of integer vectors.
</p>
<p><code>make_ego_graph</code> returns with a list of graphs.
</p>
<p><code>connect</code> returns with a new graph object.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

g &lt;- make_ring(10)
ego_size(g, order = 0, 1:3)
ego_size(g, order = 1, 1:3)
ego_size(g, order = 2, 1:3)
ego(g, order = 0, 1:3)
ego(g, order = 1, 1:3)
ego(g, order = 2, 1:3)

# attributes are preserved
V(g)$name &lt;- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j")
make_ego_graph(g, order = 2, 1:3)

# connecting to the neighborhood
g &lt;- make_ring(10)
g &lt;- connect(g, 2)
