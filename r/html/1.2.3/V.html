<h2>Vertices of a graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a vertex sequence (vs) containing all vertices of a graph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
V(graph)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The graph</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A vertex sequence is just what the name says it is: a sequence of
vertices. Vertex sequences are usually used as igraph function arguments
that refer to vertices of a graph.
</p>
<p>A vertex sequence is tied to the graph it refers to: it really denoted
the specific vertices of that graph, and cannot be used together with
another graph.
</p>
<p>At the implementation level, a vertex sequence is simply a vector
containing numeric vertex ids, but it has a special class attribute
which makes it possible to perform graph specific operations on it, like
selecting a subset of the vertices based on graph structure, or vertex
attributes.
</p>
<p>A vertex sequence is most often created by the <code>V()</code> function. The
result of this includes all vertices in increasing vertex id order. A
vertex sequence can be indexed by a numeric vector, just like a regular
R vector. See <code><a href="+5B.igraph.vs.html">[.igraph.vs</a></code> and additional links to other
vertex sequence operations below.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vertex sequence containing all vertices, in the order
of their numeric vertex ids.
</p>


<h3>Indexing vertex sequences</h3>

<p>Vertex sequences mostly behave like regular vectors, but there are some
additional indexing operations that are specific for them;
e.g. selecting vertices based on graph structure, or based on vertex
attributes. See <code><a href="+5B.igraph.vs.html">[.igraph.vs</a></code> for details.
</p>


<h3>Querying or setting attributes</h3>

<p>Vertex sequences can be used to query or set attributes for the
vertices in the sequence. See <code><a href="+24.igraph.vs.html">$.igraph.vs</a></code> for details.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
# Vertex ids of an unnamed graph
g &lt;- make_ring(10)
V(g)

# Vertex ids of a named graph
g2 &lt;- make_ring(10) %&gt;%
  set_vertex_attr("name", value = letters[1:10])
V(g2)
