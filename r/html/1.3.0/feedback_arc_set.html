<h2>Finding a feedback arc set in a graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A feedback arc set of a graph is a subset of edges whose removal breaks all
cycles in the graph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
feedback_arc_set(graph, weights = NULL, algo = c("approx_eades", "exact_ip"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>Potential edge weights. If the graph has an edge
attribute called &lsquo;<code>weight</code>&rsquo;, and this argument is
<code>NULL</code>, then the edge attribute is used automatically. The goal of
the feedback arc set problem is to find a feedback arc set with the smallest
total weight.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>algo</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies the algorithm to use. &ldquo;<code>exact_ip</code>&rdquo; solves
the feedback arc set problem with an exact integer programming algorithm that
guarantees that the total weight of the removed edges is as small as possible.
&ldquo;<code>approx_eades</code>&rdquo; uses a fast (linear-time) approximation
algorithm from Eades, Lin and Smyth. &ldquo;<code>exact</code>&rdquo; is an alias to
&ldquo;<code>exact_ip</code>&rdquo; while &ldquo;<code>approx</code>&rdquo; is an alias to
&ldquo;<code>approx_eades</code>&rdquo;.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Feedback arc sets are typically used in directed graphs. The removal of a
feedback arc set of a directed graph ensures that the remaining graph is a
directed acyclic graph (DAG). For undirected graphs, the removal of a feedback
arc set ensures that the remaining graph is a forest (i.e. every connected
component is a tree).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An edge sequence (by default, but see the <code>return.vs.es</code> option
of <code><a href="igraph_options.html">igraph_options</a></code>) containing the feedback arc set.
