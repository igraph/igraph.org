<h2>Transitivity of a graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transitivity measures the probability that the adjacent vertices of a vertex
are connected. This is sometimes also called the clustering coefficient.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
transitivity(
  graph,
  type = c("undirected", "global", "globalundirected", "localundirected", "local",
    "average", "localaverage", "localaverageundirected", "barrat", "weighted"),
  vids = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  isolates = c("NaN", "zero")
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The graph to analyze.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of the transitivity to calculate. Possible values:
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>&quot;global&quot;</dt><dd><p>The global transitivity of an undirected
graph (directed graphs are considered as undirected ones as well). This is
simply the ratio of the triangles and the connected triples in the graph.
For directed graphs the direction of the edges is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;local&quot;</dt><dd><p>The local transitivity of an undirected graph, this is
calculated for each vertex given in the <code>vids</code> argument. The local
transitivity of a vertex is the ratio of the triangles connected to the
vertex and the triples centered on the vertex. For directed graph the
direction of the edges is ignored. Note that calculations do not work
reliably in non-simple graphs, and since the presence of mutual edges in
a directed graph becomes non-simple when treated as undirected, therefore
it is advised to avoid using this function on non-simple and/or directed
graphs. igraph prints a warning in these cases; the warning will be turned
into an error in igraph 1.3.0.</p>
</dd> <dt>&quot;undirected&quot;</dt><dd><p>This is the
same as <code>global</code>.</p>
</dd> <dt>&quot;globalundirected&quot;</dt><dd><p>This is the same as
<code>global</code>.</p>
</dd> <dt>&quot;localundirected&quot;</dt><dd><p>This is the same as
<code>local</code>.</p>
</dd> <dt>&quot;barrat&quot;</dt><dd><p>The weighted transitivity as defined A.
Barrat. See details below.</p>
</dd> <dt>&quot;weighted&quot;</dt><dd><p>The same as
<code>barrat</code>.</p>
</dd> </dl>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>vids</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vertex ids for the local transitivity will be calculated.
This will be ignored for global transitivity types.  The default value is
<code>NULL</code>, in this case all vertices are considered. It is slightly faster
to supply <code>NULL</code> here than <code>V(graph)</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional weights for weighted transitivity. It is ignored for
other transitivity measures. If it is <code>NULL</code> (the default) and the
graph has a <code>weight</code> edge attribute, then it is used automatically.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>isolates</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character scalar, defines how to treat vertices with degree
zero and one. If it is &lsquo;<code>NaN</code>&rsquo; then they local transitivity is
reported as <code>NaN</code> and they are not included in the averaging, for the
transitivity types that calculate an average. If there are no vertices with
degree two or higher, then the averaging will still result <code>NaN</code>. If it
is &lsquo;<code>zero</code>&rsquo;, then we report 0 transitivity for them, and they
are included in the averaging, if an average is calculated.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that there are essentially two classes of transitivity measures, one is
a vertex-level, the other a graph level property.
</p>
<p>There are several generalizations of transitivity to weighted graphs, here
we use the definition by A. Barrat, this is a local vertex-level quantity,
its formula is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>
weighted C_i = 1/s_i 1/(k_i-1) sum( (w_ij+w_ih)/2 a_ij a_ih a_jh, j, h)</i></p>

<p><i>s_i</i> is the strength of vertex <i>i</i>, see
<code><a href="strength.html">strength</a></code>, <i>a_ij</i> are elements of the
adjacency matrix, <i>k_i</i> is the vertex degree, <i>w_ij</i>
are the weights.
</p>
<p>This formula gives back the normal not-weighted local transitivity if all
the edge weights are the same.
</p>
<p>The <code>barrat</code> type of transitivity does not work for graphs with
multiple and/or loop edges. If you want to calculate it for a directed
graph, call <code><a href="as.undirected.html">as.undirected</a></code> with the <code>collapse</code> mode first.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For &lsquo;<code>global</code>&rsquo; a single number, or <code>NaN</code> if there
are no connected triples in the graph.
</p>
<p>For &lsquo;<code>local</code>&rsquo; a vector of transitivity scores, one for each
vertex in &lsquo;<code>vids</code>&rsquo;.
