<h2>Sample trees randomly and uniformly</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>sample_tree</code> generates a random with a given number of nodes uniform
at random from the set of labelled trees.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
sample_tree(n, directed = FALSE, method = c("lerw", "prufer"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of nodes in the tree</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to create a directed tree. The edges of the tree are
oriented away from the root.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The algorithm to use to generate the tree. &lsquo;prufer&rsquo;
samples Prufer sequences uniformly and then converts the sampled sequence to
a tree. &lsquo;lerw&rsquo; performs a loop-erased random walk on the complete
graph to uniformly sampleits spanning trees. (This is also known as Wilson's
algorithm). The default is &lsquo;lerw&rsquo;. Note that the method based on
Prufer sequences does not support directed trees at the moment.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In other words, the function generates each possible labelled tree with the
given number of nodes with the same probability.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A graph object.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

g &lt;- sample_tree(100, method="lerw")
