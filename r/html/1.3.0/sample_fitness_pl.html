<h2>Scale-free random graphs, from vertex fitness scores</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a non-growing random graph with expected power-law
degree distributions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
sample_fitness_pl(
  no.of.nodes,
  no.of.edges,
  exponent.out,
  exponent.in = -1,
  loops = FALSE,
  multiple = FALSE,
  finite.size.correction = TRUE
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>no.of.nodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of vertices in the generated graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>no.of.edges</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of edges in the generated graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>exponent.out</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric scalar, the power law exponent of the degree
distribution. For directed graphs, this specifies the exponent of the
out-degree distribution. It must be greater than or equal to 2. If you pass
<code>Inf</code> here, you will get back an Erdos-Renyi random network.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>exponent.in</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric scalar. If negative, the generated graph will be
undirected. If greater than or equal to 2, this argument specifies the
exponent of the in-degree distribution. If non-negative but less than 2, an
error will be generated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>loops</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to allow loop edges in the generated
graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multiple</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to allow multiple edges in the
generated graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>finite.size.correction</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to use the proposed
finite size correction of Cho et al., see references below.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This game generates a directed or undirected random graph where the degrees
of vertices follow power-law distributions with prescribed exponents. For
directed graphs, the exponents of the in- and out-degree distributions may
be specified separately.
</p>
<p>The game simply uses <code><a href="sample_fitness.html">sample_fitness</a></code> with appropriately
constructed fitness vectors. In particular, the fitness of vertex <i>i</i> is
<i>i^(-alpha)</i>, where <i>alpha = 1/(gamma-1)</i> and gamma is
the exponent given in the arguments.
</p>
<p>To remove correlations between in- and out-degrees in case of directed
graphs, the in-fitness vector will be shuffled after it has been set up and
before <code><a href="sample_fitness.html">sample_fitness</a></code> is called.
</p>
<p>Note that significant finite size effects may be observed for exponents
smaller than 3 in the original formulation of the game. This function
provides an argument that lets you remove the finite size effects by
assuming that the fitness of vertex <i>i</i> is
<i>(i+i0-1)^(-alpha)</i> where <i>i0</i> is a
constant chosen appropriately to ensure that the maximum degree is less than
the square root of the number of edges times the average degree; see the
paper of Chung and Lu, and Cho et al for more details.
