<h2>Generate scale-free graphs according to the Barabasi-Albert model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The BA-model is a very simple stochastic algorithm for building a graph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>sample_pa(
  n,
  power = 1,
  m = NULL,
  out.dist = NULL,
  out.seq = NULL,
  out.pref = FALSE,
  zero.appeal = 1,
  directed = TRUE,
  algorithm = c("psumtree", "psumtree-multiple", "bag"),
  start.graph = NULL
)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of vertices.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>power</code></td>
<td>
<p>The power of the preferential attachment, the default is one,
ie. linear preferential attachment.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric constant, the number of edges to add in each time step This
argument is only used if both <code>out.dist</code> and <code>out.seq</code> are omitted
or NULL.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>out.dist</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector, the distribution of the number of edges to
add in each time step. This argument is only used if the <code>out.seq</code>
argument is omitted or NULL.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>out.seq</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector giving the number of edges to add in each time
step. Its first element is ignored as no edges are added in the first time
step.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>out.pref</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, if true the total degree is used for calculating
the citation probability, otherwise the in-degree is used.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>zero.appeal</code></td>
<td>
<p>The &lsquo;attractiveness&rsquo; of the vertices with no
adjacent edges. See details below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to create a directed graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>algorithm</code></td>
<td>
<p>The algorithm to use for the graph generation.
<code>psumtree</code> uses a partial prefix-sum tree to generate the graph, this
algorithm can handle any <code>power</code> and <code>zero.appeal</code> values and
never generates multiple edges.  <code>psumtree-multiple</code> also uses a
partial prefix-sum tree, but the generation of multiple edges is allowed.
Before the 0.6 version igraph used this algorithm if <code>power</code> was not
one, or <code>zero.appeal</code> was not one.  <code>bag</code> is the algorithm that
was previously (before version 0.6) used if <code>power</code> was one and
<code>zero.appeal</code> was one as well. It works by putting the ids of the
vertices into a bag (multiset, really), exactly as many times as their
(in-)degree, plus once more. Then the required number of cited vertices are
drawn from the bag, with replacement. This method might generate multiple
edges. It only works if <code>power</code> and <code>zero.appeal</code> are equal one.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>start.graph</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>NULL</code> or an igraph graph. If a graph, then the
supplied graph is used as a starting graph for the preferential attachment
algorithm. The graph should have at least one vertex. If a graph is supplied
here and the <code>out.seq</code> argument is not <code>NULL</code>, then it should
contain the out degrees of the new vertices only, not the ones in the
<code>start.graph</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a simple stochastic algorithm to generate a graph. It is a discrete
time step model and in each time step a single vertex is added.
</p>
<p>We start with a single vertex and no edges in the first time step. Then we
add one vertex in each time step and the new vertex initiates some edges to
old vertices. The probability that an old vertex is chosen is given by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">P[i] \sim k_i^\alpha+a</code>
</p>
<p> where <code class="reqn">k_i</code>
is the in-degree of vertex <code class="reqn">i</code> in the current time step (more precisely
the number of adjacent edges of <code class="reqn">i</code> which were not initiated by <code class="reqn">i</code>
itself) and <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> and <code class="reqn">a</code> are parameters given by the
<code>power</code> and <code>zero.appeal</code> arguments.
</p>
<p>The number of edges initiated in a time step is given by the <code>m</code>,
<code>out.dist</code> and <code>out.seq</code> arguments. If <code>out.seq</code> is given and
not NULL then it gives the number of edges to add in a vector, the first
element is ignored, the second is the number of edges to add in the second
time step and so on. If <code>out.seq</code> is not given or null and
<code>out.dist</code> is given and not NULL then it is used as a discrete
distribution to generate the number of edges in each time step. Its first
element is the probability that no edges will be added, the second is the
probability that one edge is added, etc. (<code>out.dist</code> does not need to
sum up to one, it normalized automatically.) <code>out.dist</code> should contain
non-negative numbers and at east one element should be positive.
</p>
<p>If both <code>out.seq</code> and <code>out.dist</code> are omitted or NULL then <code>m</code>
will be used, it should be a positive integer constant and <code>m</code> edges
will be added in each time step.
</p>
<p><code>sample_pa</code> generates a directed graph by default, set
<code>directed</code> to <code>FALSE</code> to generate an undirected graph. Note that
even if an undirected graph is generated <code class="reqn">k_i</code> denotes the number
of adjacent edges not initiated by the vertex itself and not the total (in-
+ out-) degree of the vertex, unless the <code>out.pref</code> argument is set to
<code>TRUE</code>.
