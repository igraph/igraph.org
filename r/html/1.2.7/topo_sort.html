<h2>Topological sorting of vertices in a graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph is a linear ordering of
its nodes where each node comes before all nodes to which it has edges.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
topo_sort(graph, mode = c("out", "all", "in"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph, should be directed</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies how to use the direction of the edges.  For
&ldquo;<code>out</code>&rdquo;, the sorting order ensures that each node comes before
all nodes to which it has edges, so nodes with no incoming edges go first.
For &ldquo;<code>in</code>&rdquo;, it is quite the opposite: each node comes before all
nodes from which it receives edges. Nodes with no outgoing edges go first.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Every DAG has at least one topological sort, and may have many.  This
function returns a possible topological sort among them. If the graph is not
acyclic (it has at least one cycle), a partial topological sort is returned
and a warning is issued.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vertex sequence (by default, but see the <code>return.vs.es</code>
option of <code><a href="igraph_options.html">igraph_options</a></code>) containing vertices in
topologically sorted order.
