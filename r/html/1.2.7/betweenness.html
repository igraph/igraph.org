<h2>Vertex and edge betweenness centrality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The vertex and edge betweenness are (roughly) defined by the number of
geodesics (shortest paths) going through a vertex or an edge.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
estimate_betweenness(
  graph,
  vids = V(graph),
  directed = TRUE,
  cutoff,
  weights = NULL,
  nobigint = TRUE
)

betweenness(
  graph,
  v = V(graph),
  directed = TRUE,
  weights = NULL,
  nobigint = TRUE,
  normalized = FALSE
)

edge_betweenness(graph, e = E(graph), directed = TRUE, weights = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The graph to analyze.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>vids</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vertices for which the vertex betweenness estimation will be
calculated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, whether directed paths should be considered while
determining the shortest paths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cutoff</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum path length to consider when calculating the
betweenness. If zero or negative then there is no such limit.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
betweenness. If the graph has a <code>weight</code> edge attribute, then this is
used by default. Weights are used to calculate weighted shortest paths,
so they are interpreted as distances.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nobigint</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to use big integers during the
calculation. This is only required for lattice-like graphs that have very
many shortest paths between a pair of vertices. If <code>TRUE</code> (the
default), then big integers are not used.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>v</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vertices for which the vertex betweenness will be calculated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>normalized</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to normalize the betweenness
scores. If <code>TRUE</code>, then the results are normalized by the number of ordered
or unordered vertex pairs in directed and undirected graphs, respectively.
In an undirected graph,            
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Bnorm=2*B/((n-1)*(n-2)),</i></p>
<p> where
<i>Bnorm</i> is the normalized, <i>B</i> the raw betweenness, and <i>n</i>
is the number of vertices in the graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>e</code></td>
<td>
<p>The edges for which the edge betweenness will be calculated.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The vertex betweenness of vertex <code>v</code> is defined by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>sum( g_ivj / g_ij,
i!=j,i!=v,j!=v)</i></p>

<p>The edge betweenness of edge <code>e</code> is defined by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>sum( g_iej / g_ij, i!=j).</i></p>

<p><code>betweenness</code> calculates vertex betweenness, <code>edge_betweenness</code>
calculates edge betweenness.
</p>
<p><code>estimate_betweenness</code> only considers paths of length <code>cutoff</code> or
smaller, this can be run for larger graphs, as the running time is not
quadratic (if <code>cutoff</code> is small). If <code>cutoff</code> is zero or negative
then the function calculates the exact betweenness scores.
</p>
<p><code>estimate_edge_betweenness</code> is similar, but for edges.
</p>
<p>For calculating the betweenness a similar algorithm to the one proposed by
Brandes (see References) is used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector with the betweenness score for each vertex in
<code>v</code> for <code>betweenness</code>.
</p>
<p>A numeric vector with the edge betweenness score for each edge in <code>e</code>
for <code>edge_betweenness</code>.
</p>
<p><code>estimate_betweenness</code> returns the estimated betweenness scores for
vertices in <code>vids</code>, <code>estimate_edge_betweenness</code> the estimated edge
betweenness score for <em>all</em> edges; both in a numeric vector.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>edge_betweenness</code> might give false values for graphs with
multiple edges.
