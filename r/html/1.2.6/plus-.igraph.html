<h2>Add vertices, edges or another graph to a graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add vertices, edges or another graph to a graph
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
## S3 method for class 'igraph'
e1 + e2
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>e1</code></td>
<td>
<p>First argument, probably an igraph graph, but see details
below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>e2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Second argument, see details below.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The plus operator can be used to add vertices or edges to graph.
The actual operation that is performed depends on the type of the
right hand side argument.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> If is is another igraph graph object and they are both
named graphs, then the union of the two graphs are calculated,
see <code><a href="union.html">union</a></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If it is another igraph graph object, but either of the two
are not named, then the disjoint union of
the two graphs is calculated, see <code><a href="disjoint_union.html">disjoint_union</a></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If it is a numeric scalar, then the specified number of vertices
are added to the graph.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If it is a character scalar or vector, then it is interpreted as
the names of the vertices to add to the graph.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If it is an object created with the <code><a href="vertex.html">vertex</a></code> or
<code><a href="vertices.html">vertices</a></code> function, then new vertices are added to the
graph. This form is appropriate when one wants to add some vertex
attributes as well. The operands of the <code>vertices</code> function
specifies the number of vertices to add and their attributes as
well.
</p>
<p>The unnamed arguments of <code>vertices</code> are concatenated and
used as the &lsquo;<code>name</code>&rsquo; vertex attribute (i.e. vertex
names), the named arguments will be added as additional vertex
attributes. Examples: </p>
<pre>  g &lt;- g +
        vertex(shape="circle", color= "red")
  g &lt;- g + vertex("foo", color="blue")
  g &lt;- g + vertex("bar", "foobar")
  g &lt;- g + vertices("bar2", "foobar2", color=1:2, shape="rectangle")</pre>
<p><code>vertex</code> is just an alias to <code>vertices</code>, and it is
provided for readability. The user should use it if a single vertex
is added to the graph.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If it is an object created with the <code><a href="edge.html">edge</a></code> or
<code><a href="edges.html">edges</a></code> function, then new edges will be added to the
graph. The new edges and possibly their attributes can be specified as
the arguments of the <code>edges</code> function.
</p>
<p>The unnamed arguments of <code>edges</code> are concatenated and used
as vertex ids of the end points of the new edges. The named
arguments will be added as edge attributes.
</p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<pre>  g &lt;- make_empty_graph() +
         vertices(letters[1:10]) +
         vertices("foo", "bar", "bar2", "foobar2")
  g &lt;- g + edge("a", "b")
  g &lt;- g + edges("foo", "bar", "bar2", "foobar2")
  g &lt;- g + edges(c("bar", "foo", "foobar2", "bar2"), color="red", weight=1:2)</pre>
<p>See more examples below.
</p>
<p><code>edge</code> is just an alias to <code>edges</code> and it is provided
for readability. The user should use it if a single edge is added to
the graph.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If it is an object created with the <code><a href="path.html">path</a></code> function, then
new edges that form a path are added. The edges and possibly their
attributes are specified as the arguments to the <code>path</code>
function. The non-named arguments are concatenated and interpreted
as the vertex ids along the path. The remaining arguments are added
as edge attributes.
</p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<pre>  g &lt;- make_empty_graph() + vertices(letters[1:10])
  g &lt;- g + path("a", "b", "c", "d")
  g &lt;- g + path("e", "f", "g", weight=1:2, color="red")
  g &lt;- g + path(c("f", "c", "j", "d"), width=1:3, color="green")</pre>
</li></ul>

<p>It is important to note that, although the plus operator is
commutative, i.e. is possible to write </p>
<pre>  graph &lt;- "foo" + make_empty_graph()</pre>
<p>it is not associative, e.g. </p>
<pre>  graph &lt;- "foo" + "bar" + make_empty_graph()</pre>
<p>results a syntax error, unless parentheses are used: </p>
<pre>  graph &lt;- "foo" + ( "bar" + make_empty_graph() )</pre>
<p>For clarity, we suggest to always put the graph object on the left
hand side of the operator: </p>
<pre>  graph &lt;- make_empty_graph() + "foo" + "bar"</pre>

g &lt;- make_empty_graph() + vertices(letters[1:10])

# Add edges to make it a ring
