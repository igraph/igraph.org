<h2>Subgraph of a graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>subgraph</code> creates a subgraph of a graph, containing only the specified
vertices and all the edges among them.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
subgraph(graph, v)

induced_subgraph(
  graph,
  vids,
  impl = c("auto", "copy_and_delete", "create_from_scratch")
)

subgraph.edges(graph, eids, delete.vertices = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The original graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>v</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector, the vertices of the original graph which will
form the subgraph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>vids</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector, the vertices of the original graph which will
form the subgraph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>impl</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character scalar, to choose between two implementation of the
subgraph calculation. &lsquo;<code>copy_and_delete</code>&rsquo; copies the graph
first, and then deletes the vertices and edges that are not included in the
result graph. &lsquo;<code>create_from_scratch</code>&rsquo; searches for all vertices
and edges that must be kept and then uses them to create the graph from
scratch. &lsquo;<code>auto</code>&rsquo; chooses between the two implementations
automatically, using heuristics based on the size of the original and the
result graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>eids</code></td>
<td>
<p>The edge ids of the edges that will be kept in the result graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>delete.vertices</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to remove vertices that do
not have any adjacent edges in <code>eids</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>induced_subgraph</code> calculates the induced subgraph of a set of vertices
in a graph. This means that exactly the specified vertices and all the edges
between them will be kept in the result graph.
</p>
<p><code>subgraph.edges</code> calculates the subgraph of a graph. For this function
one can specify the vertices and edges to keep. This function will be
renamed to <code>subgraph</code> in the next major version of igraph.
</p>
<p>The <code>subgraph</code> function does the same as <code>induced.graph</code> currently
(assuming &lsquo;<code>auto</code>&rsquo; as the <code>impl</code> argument), but it is
deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of igraph.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A new graph object.
