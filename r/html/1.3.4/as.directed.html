<h2>Convert between directed and undirected graphs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>as.directed</code> converts an undirected graph to directed,
<code>as.undirected</code> does the opposite, it converts a directed graph to
undirected.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>as.directed(graph, mode = c("mutual", "arbitrary", "random", "acyclic"))

as.undirected(
  graph,
  mode = c("collapse", "each", "mutual"),
  edge.attr.comb = igraph_opt("edge.attr.comb")
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The graph to convert.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character constant, defines the conversion algorithm. For
<code>as.directed</code> it can be <code>mutual</code> or <code>arbitrary</code>. For
<code>as.undirected</code> it can be <code>each</code>, <code>collapse</code> or
<code>mutual</code>. See details below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>edge.attr.comb</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies what to do with edge attributes, if
<code>mode="collapse"</code> or <code>mode="mutual"</code>.  In these cases many edges
might be mapped to a single one in the new graph, and their attributes are
combined. Please see <code><a href="attribute.combination.html">attribute.combination</a></code> for details on
this.</p>

<p>Conversion algorithms for <code>as.directed</code>: </p>

<dl>
<dt>&quot;arbitrary&quot;</dt><dd><p>The number of edges in the graph stays the same, an
arbitrarily directed edge is created for each undirected edge, but the
direction of the edge is deterministic (i.e. it always points the same
way if you call the function multiple times).</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;mutual&quot;</dt><dd><p>Two directed edges are created for each undirected
edge, one in each direction.</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;random&quot;</dt><dd><p>The number of edges in the graph stays the same, and
a randomly directed edge is created for each undirected edge. You
will get different results if you call the function multiple times
with the same graph.</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;acyclic&quot;</dt><dd><p>The number of edges in the graph stays the same, and
a directed edge is created for each undirected edge such that the
resulting graph is guaranteed to be acyclic. This is achieved by ensuring
that edges always point from a lower index vertex to a higher index.
Note that the graph may include cycles of length 1 if the original
graph contained loop edges.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Conversion algorithms for <code>as.undirected</code>: </p>

<dl>
<dt>&quot;each&quot;</dt><dd><p>The number of edges remains constant, an undirected edge
is created for each directed one, this version might create graphs with
multiple edges.</p>
</dd> <dt>&quot;collapse&quot;</dt><dd><p>One undirected edge will be created
for each pair of vertices which are connected with at least one directed
edge, no multiple edges will be created.</p>
</dd> <dt>&quot;mutual&quot;</dt><dd><p>One
undirected edge will be created for each pair of mutual edges. Non-mutual
edges are ignored. This mode might create multiple edges if there are more
than one mutual edge pairs between the same pair of vertices.  </p>
</dd> </dl>
