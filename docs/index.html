<p>Release 0.8.0 of igraph&#39;s Python interface follows the recent release of
version 0.8.0 of the C core with many bug fixes that have accumulated over the
last five years, and an improved build process that does not require the C core
of igraph to be downloaded at the time when <code>python-igraph</code> is installed; the
tarball of <code>python-igraph</code> already bundles the appropriate version of the
C core in it.</p>

<h3>Precompiled Python wheels</h2>

<p>Starting from this release, we will also aim to provide pre-compiled Python
wheels for most platforms. The current release includes Python wheels for
Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 on Windows, macOS and Linux, so most users will
not have to compile anything when installing <code>python-igraph</code> from pip.
Currently the only limitation is that the Windows wheels do not support GraphML
import; this will be fixed in the next patch release (0.8.1).</p>

<h2>End of support for Python 2.7</h2>

<p><code>python-igraph</code> 0.8.x will also be the <em>last</em> version that supports Python 2.7.
Since Python 2 has <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">reached its end of life</a>,
we will drop support for Python 2 before <code>python-igraph</code> 0.9 so we can simplify
some parts of the codebase where we needed to introduce additional code to
support both Python versions.</p>

<p>As for Python 3, we are committing ourselves to supporting <em>at least</em> the last
three minor releases of Python 3.</p>

<p>Although we are not suporting PyPy officially, <code>python-igraph</code> will also be
tested with PyPy regularly in a CI environment, and we will strive to fix any
issues that arise with PyPy. If you use <code>python-igraph</code> with PyPy and you are
willing to become an official maintainer responsible for PyPy compatibility,
please let us know in the <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group/">community forum</a>.</p>

<h2>New community forum</h3>

<p>Concurrently with the release of igraph 0.8, we have launched <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group/">a new community
forum</a>, which replaces the mailing list as
the main support channel. The community forum is also meant for users of
<code>python-igraph</code>, so If you are a current <code>python-igraph</code> user or just
interested in the project, please join!</p>

<p>We would like to thank everyone who reported issues, contributed features or
fixes, or edited the documentation. igraph is an open-source project run by
volunteers. <em>As always, your contributions are very welcome!</em></p>

<p>Release 0.8.0 of igraph&#39;s C core, coming almost five years after 0.7.1, is a major improvement with several new features, performance and robustness improvements, and many bug fixes. New functionality includes additional graph generators, functions for handling trees, new community detection methods, improved clique finding, spectral graph embedding, as well as several other features. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraph/blob/0.8.0/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for more details.</p>

<p>We would like to thank everyone who reported issues, contributed features or fixes, or edited the documentation. igraph is an open-source project run by volunteers. <em>As always, your contributions are very welcome!</em></p>

<p>Most people use igraph through its high-level interfaces for <a href="https://igraph.org/r/">R</a>, <a href="https://igraph.org/python/">Python</a> or <a href="http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM">Mathematica</a>. A new release of the Python interface, incorporating all these improvements, is expected to be released in a few weeks. The R and Mathematica interfaces already include some of the improvements, and will continue to integrate more.</p>

<p>Concurrently with the release of igraph 0.8, we are launching <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group/">a new community forum</a>, which will replace the mailing list as the main support channel. If you are a current igraph user or just interested in the project, please join!</p>

  <h3>Release Notes</h3>

<p>This is a new major release, with a lot of UI changes. We tried to
make it easier to use, with short and easy to remember, consistent
function names. Unfortunately this also means that many functions
have new names now, but don&#39;t worry, all the old names still work.</p>

<p>Apart from the new names, the biggest change in this release is
that most functions that used to return numeric vertex or edge ids,
return vertex/edge sequences now. This requires some time to get used
to and if you want the numeric ids instead, just use the <code>as.vector()</code>
function on the vertex/edge sequences.</p>

<p>We will update the documentation on this site, once the package
is on CRAN and available for all architectures.</p><p><a href="/2015/06/24/igraph-1.0.0-r.html">More &#8594;</a></p>

  <p>A couple of days ago we changed how we use GitHub for igraph
development. Our goal is to make igraph development more accessible, and
our build process simpler. Instead of using a common repository for
everything, we now use separate repos for the igraph C library, the R
package and the Python extension. The igraph.org website was already in a
separate repository, and we will also break up the R package, by putting
loosely coupled parts in their own packages and repositories.</p>

<p>Main igraph repositories now:</p>

<ul>
<li>igraph C library: <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraph">https://github.com/igraph/igraph</a></li>
<li>igraph R package: <a href="https://github.com/igraph/rigraph">https://github.com/igraph/rigraph</a></li>
