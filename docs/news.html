  _Cross-posted on the [cynkra blog](https://cynkra.com/blog/2025-03-17-igraph-isc-setting-success-decade/)._


One year ago, a small group of us at cynkra submitted a project proposal to the R Consortium's ISC, which got approved.
We are very grateful for this [support](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/2024-group-1.html#setting-up-igraph-for-success-in-the-next-decade).
In this post we shall explain what the motivation for our project was, what we accomplishedâ€¦ and what we hope to work on next!<p><a href="/2025/04/10/igraph-isc-setting-success-decade.html">More &#8594;</a></p>

  [python-igraph](https://python.igraph.org/en/0.11.8/) 0.11.8, the seventh bugfix release of the 0.11 series, has arrived. The primary reason for this release is to update the C core of igraph to 0.10.14, which brings a few bugfixes and also a few new functions to the Python interface. This release also adds support for Python 3.13. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/releases/tag/0.11.8) for more details.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing `pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the source code are also available from the [Python Package Index page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.11.8/).

  We're thrilled to announce that igraph 2.0 has been released!
In this post, we highlight the most important changes.

# The R package is now in sync with the C core

This major release brings development in line with [the igraph C library](https://igraph.org/c/).
Version 1.6.0 of the R package used version 0.9.10 of the C core. 
The changes in the 0.10 series of the C core are now taken up in version 2.0 of the R package. 
Having the R package use the latest version of the C core was a huge undertaking, and is a great milestone which makes the many improvements from version 0.10 of the C core available to R users.

Improvements made in the C core will be made available more easily in
functions in the R package. 
See the [complete changelog](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/blob/main/src/vendor/cigraph/CHANGELOG.md) of the C core. 
While we tried to maintain compatibility with version 1.6.0 of the R interface, it wasn't always possible. 
Refer to the "Breaking changes" sections in the changelog of the R package
([breaking changes section](https://r.igraph.org/news/index.html#breaking-changes-2-0-0)).
If you maintain a package that depends on igraph, you may have heard from us.

The move to version 0.10 of C/igraph brings many quality improvements,
including support for graphs with billions of vertices and edges on 64-bit computers, much more stringent error checking, 
as well as lots of improvements to robustness, reliability and mathematical consistency
across functions.

Future work will aim at further automating the generation of R code from C code, making improved C core functionality more quickly available to R users. 
Additionally, we plan to expose more C core functions, since not all functions are available to R users just yet.

# Improvements to the documentation

The igraph R package now has a [website](https://r.igraph.org/), generated with the popular pkgdown R package, that is to say, a website that has a predictable structure and that includes a search functionality. 
The website now features an introductory vignette contributed by [Adrian Diaz](https://github.com/adriandiazlab) and Fabio Zanini in both [English](https://r.igraph.org/articles/igraph.html) and [Spanish](https://r.igraph.org/articles/igraph_ES.html).

# Towards a more explicit lifecycle

We are in the middle of efforts aimed at making the lifecycle of functions more explicit so that you might know what function is deprecated, and which function is more experimental. 
For instance, we will slowly be removing most ["dotted-names functions"](https://r.igraph.org/articles/deprecated-dot-case.html),
like add.edges() that is now add_edges(), although both versions currently still work. 
The [`is_biconnected()`
function](https://r.igraph.org/reference/is_biconnected.html) is an example of an experimental function, that is to say, a C function that was just exposed.

  [python-igraph](https://python.igraph.org/en/0.11.5/) 0.11.5, the fifth bugfix release of the 0.11 series, has arrived. The primary reason for this release is to update the C core of igraph to 0.10.12, which brings quite a few bugfixes to the Python interface. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/releases/tag/0.11.5) for more details.

  [python-igraph](https://python.igraph.org/en/0.11.3/) 0.11.3, the third bugfix release of the 0.11 series, has arrived. The primary reason for this release is to update the C core of igraph to 0.10.8, which brings quite a few bugfixes to the Python interface. This release also fixes a bug in the Matplotlib backend with curved undirected edges. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/releases/tag/0.11.3) for more details.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing `pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the source code are also available from the [Python Package Index page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.11.3/).

  Just in time before the Christmas holidays, [IGraph/M](http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM) 0.6.5 is now released. This version (along with the unreleased 0.6.4) brings greatly improved performance when computing proximity graphs, new convenience functions, as well as robustness improvements. As usual, you can conveniently upgrade by running the installer script, using the following command:

```
Get["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szhorvat/IGraphM/master/IGInstaller.m"]
```

#### 0.6.5

Other:

 - Improved error checking and added more internal consistency checks to help debug issues with recent Mathematica versions.

#### 0.6.4

Added:

 - `IGBetaWeightedGabrielGraph` for computing the Î² value where each edge of a lune-based Î²-skeleton would disappear (experimental function).
 - `IGModularityMatrix` gives the modularity matrix of a network.
 - `IGCanonicalLabeledGraph` creates a canonical representation of a labeled graph without changing vertex names. Graphs which are considered equivalent by `IGSameGraphQ` have the same canonical representation. It is intended for removing duplicate graphs using `DeleteDuplicatesBy`.
 - `IGCanonicalEdgeList` creates a canonical representation of an edge list, in a manner similar to `IGCanonicalLabeledGraph`.

Other:

 - Documentation improvements
 - Significant performance improvements for the calculation of lune and circle based Î² skeletons when using large Î² values.

```
Get["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szhorvat/IGraphM/master/IGInstaller.m"]
```

#### IGraph/M 0.6.3

Changed:

 - When an invalid vertex is passed to IGraph/M functions, now the message shown is `IGraphM::invv` instead of `VertexIndex::inv`.

Fixed:

 - In rare cases, vertex names that were lists of other vertex names in the same graph were misinterpreted. This affected only Mathematica 12.0 and later.
 - `IGCommunitiesLeadingEigenvector` is less likely to fail to converge now.
 - `IGCommunitiesLeadingEigenvector` now respects random seeds set in Mathematica. These affect only the random starting vector it uses internally, which can very rarely cause non-deterministic output.
 - `IGBarabasiAlbertGame` no longer accepts negative or zero exponents, as these were not handled correctly.
 - `IGBridges` is no longer prone to stack overflow when given very large graphs.

Other:

 - Performance improvements for `IGGraphEditor`.
 - Documentation improvements.

follow soon with _lots_ of breaking changes as we clean up the API in
preparation for a future 1.0 release.

If you have a project that currently relies on igraph 0.9, it is advised that
you update the project to use 0.9.10 and then start adapting it as soon as

  [python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.9.11, the ninth bugfix release
of the 0.9 series, has arrived.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing
`pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most
supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the
source code are also available from the [Python Package Index
page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.9.11/).

This is the first release that provides pre-compiled `musllinux` wheels for
environments running Alpine Linux.

  Our efforts to bring the R interface of igraph closer to the recent
developments of the C core continues: we have released
[R-igraph](https://igraph.org/r/) 1.3.0, which updates the C core of igraph
within the R interface to version 0.9.7, which is now only one patch version
behind the mainline C core. The update fixes lots of bugs compared to the
previous release and adds quite a few new functions.

Due to the underlying changes in the C core of igraph between the 0.8 series
and 0.9.7, there are some cases when we needed to make extra efforts in the
R interface to keep things compatible with previous releases. For instance,
igraph 0.9.7 now interprets zero cutoff in the closeness, betweenness and edge
betweenness centrality functions literally, while igraph 0.8 interpreted zero
as "no cutoff". The R interface keeps the old behaviour in such cases but
prints a deprecation warning; the old behaviour will be gone in igraph 1.4.0 or
2.0.0, whichever comes first.

A patch release of R/igraph is coming soon in the next few days, which will
hopefully (finally) catch up with the 0.9 branch of the C core. We aim to let
R/igraph stabilize for a few weeks now while we work on further improvements in
the C core.

Even though we tried to do our best not to cause breaking changes for users of
igraph from R, we may have made unintentional mistakes, so please keep on

This release includes bug fixes and performance improvements only.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_reindex_membership()` does not allow negative membership indices any more.

 - `igraph_rewire_directed_edges()` now generates multigraphs when edge
   directions are ignored, to make it consistent with the directed case.

 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_gomory_hu_tree()` that returned only the equivalent
   flow tree instead of the cut tree.

 - Fixed a bug in the `IGRAPH_TO_UNDIRECTED_COLLAPSE` mode of
   `igraph_to_undirected()` that provided an incorrect merge vector to the
   attribute handler, leading to problems when edge attributes were merged
   using an attribute combination.

 - Fixed the behaviour of the `IGRAPH_ENABLE_LTO` option when it was set to
   `AUTO`; earlier versions had a bug where `AUTO` simply checked whether LTO
   is supported but then did not use LTO even if it was supported.

 - When using igraph from a CMake project, it is now checked that the project
   has the C++ language enabled. This is necessary for linking to igraph with
   CMake.

### Other

 - Improved the root selection method for disconnected graphs in the
   Reingold-Tilford layout (#1836). The new root selection method provides
   nicer results if the graph is not a tree, although it is still recommended
   to use the Sugiyama layout instead, unless the input graph is _almost_
   a tree, in which case Reingold-Tilfold may still be preferred.

 - `igraph_decompose()` is now much faster for large graphs containing many
   isolates or small components.

 - `igraph_largest_cliques()` and `igraph_clique_number()` were re-written to
   use `igraph_maximal_cliques_callback()` so they are much faster now.

 - The vendored GLPK has been upgraded to GLPK 5.0.

 - Documentation improvements.

  [python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.9.8, the sixth bugfix release of
the 0.9 series, has arrived.

The only significant change in this release is that the Python interface of igraph has been renamed
from `python-igraph` to `igraph` on PyPI. We are very grateful to
[Patrick Fuller](https://github.com/patrickfuller), the previous owner of the
`igraph` package on PyPI for giving up the ownership of `igraph` and letting us
use the name instead.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is still via `pip`; typing
`pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most
supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the
source code are also available from the [Python Package Index
page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.9.8/).

`python-igraph` will keep on working on PyPI until September 1, 2022, but it is
now only a stub package that depends on `igraph`. Running `pip install
python-igraph` will in turn install the matching version of the
[`igraph`](https://pypi.org/project/igraph) package from PyPI.

* **Projects listing `python-igraph` in their dependencies should migrate to
  using `igraph` as soon as possible** to keep on receiving updates after
  September 1, 2022.

* Maintainers who provide pre-packaged versions of `python-igraph` in Linux
  distributions should switch to following the
  [`igraph`](https://pypi.org/project/igraph) package on PyPI instead of
  `python-igraph`.

  In an attempt to bring the R interface of igraph closer to the recent
developments of the C core, we have released [R-igraph](https://igraph.org/r/)
1.2.7, the seventh bugfix release of the 1.2 series. This version updates
the C core of igraph within the R interface to version 0.8.5, which, while
still several versions behind the mainline C core, fixes a range of bugs
compared to the previous release and introduces a few new functions.

This release is only the beginning; in the next few months we aim to process
most of the issues on the [Github issue
tracker](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/issues), close the ones that are not
relevant any more, fix the ones that should be fixed, and then proceed with
updating the R interface to version 0.9.4 of the C core, which is the most
recent C core version at the time of writing.<p><a href="/2021/10/15/igraph-1.2.7-r.html">More &#8594;</a></p>

  The igraph project is proud to announce that the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) continues to fund the project in their program on [Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/). The project will receive two grants of $400,000 over the course of the next two years. One grant will help to further develop and maintain the igraph project. The other grant will help to diversify the pool of contributors and maintainers of the project, which is jointly coordinated with [Women in Network Science](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/wins), and will be led by [Brooke Foucault Welles](https://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/). 

Last year, the core library of igraph was enormously improved, making the library easier to build, easier to maintain and easier to use. However, most users are not using the C core directly, but are using it through one of the interfaces: Python, R or Mathematica. The CZI grant will support the igraph development team on improving these interfaces, by making them more intuitive to use and by integrating them more closely in the host language. Additionally, development efforts will be aimed at making the library and the interfaces easier to maintain, focusing on long-term sustainability. This ensures that igraph continues to be a useful tool for network scientists from various disciplines across the globe.

Having people committed to maintain and further develop igraph is critical to ensure its long-term viability. We made steps towards building a more inclusive and engaged community by opening a [forum](https://igraph.discourse.group) dedicated to igraph. We aim to enlarge and diversify the team of contributors and maintainers of the project. Making it easier to start using igraph and contributing to igraph is an important step. Improving documentation and tutorials helps achieve that goal, but we will also actively organize workshops for users and contributors, with a specific focus on women and non-binary people, and engage more actively on the community forum. Additionally, a mentorship programme will be setup specifically to facilitate women and non-binary people to use and contribute to igraph, paving the way for them to become maintainers of igraph. The CZI grant will enable us to engage more people in achieving these objectives.

### Changed

 - Unweighted transitivity (i.e. clustering coefficient) calculations now ignore multi-edges and edge directions instead of rejecting multigraphs and directed graphs.
 - `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` now returns an error code if the input graph has multiple edges (which is not handled correctly by the implementation yet).

### Fixed

 - `igraph_local_scan_k_ecount()` now handles loops correctly.
 - `igraph_transitivity_avglocal_undirected()` is no longer slower than `igraph_transitivity_local_undirected()`.
 - Worked around an invalid warning issued by Clang 9.0 when compiling with OpenMP.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.

The source can be obtained from [the GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.9.3).

This release includes bug fixes only.

### Added

 - OpenMP is now enabled and used by certain functions (notably PageRank calculation) when the compiler supports it. Set `IGRAPH_OPENMP_SUPPORT=OFF` at configuration time to disable this.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_get_incidence()` no longer reads and writes out of bounds when given a non-bipartite graph, but gives a warning and ignores edges within a part.
 - `igraph_dyad_census()` no longer reports an overflow on singleton graphs, and handles loops and multigraphs correctly. Undirected graphs are handled consistently and will no longer give a warning.
 - `igraph_vector_lex_cmp()` and `igraph_vector_colex_cmp()` dereferenced their arguments only once instead of twice, and therefore did not work with `igraph_vector_ptr_sort()`.
 - `igraph_maximal_cliques_subset()` and `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` corrupted the error handling stack ("finally stack") under some circumstances.
 - CMake package files did not respect `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`. This only affected Linux distributions which install into `lib64` or other locations instead of `lib`.
 - The parser sources could not be generated when igraph was in a location that contained spaces in its path.
 - igraph no longer links to the math library (`libm`) when this is not necessary.
 - `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` is now defined during compilation to enable compatibility with UWP.
 - Fixed a compilation issue on MSYS / MinGW when link-time optimization was enabled and the `MSYS Makefiles` CMake generator was used. Some source files in igraph were renamed as a consequence, but these should not affect users of the library.

### Deprecated

 - `igraph_rng_min()` is now deprecated; assume a constant zero as its return value if you used this function in your own code.

### Other

 - Updated the vendored CXSparse library to version 3.2.0

 - CMake package files are now installed with igraph. This allows `find_package(igraph)` to find igraph and detect the appropriate compilation options for projects that link to it.

### Fixed

 - igraph can now be used as a CMake subproject in other CMake-based projects.
 - The documentaton can now be built from the release tarball.
 - Configuration will no longer fail when the release tarball is extracted into a subdirectory of an unrelated git repository.
 - The generated pkg-config file was incorrect when `CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>` variables were absolute paths.
 - On Unix-like systems, the library name is now `libigraph.so.0.0.0`, as it used to be for igraph 0.8 and earlier.
 - Fixed a return type mismatch in parser sources, and fixed some warnings with recent versions of gcc.
 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_get_shortest_paths_dijkstra()` and `igraph_get_shortest_paths_bellman_ford()` that returned incorrect results for unreachable vertices.

### Other

 - Improved installation instructions and tutorial.

  [python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.9.1, the first bugfix release of
the 0.9 series, has arrived.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing
`pip install python-igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most
supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the
source code are also available from the [Python Package Index

  [C/igraph](https://igraph.org/c/) 0.9.1, the first bugfix release of the 0.9
series, has arrived.

The source can be obtained from [the GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.9.1).

This release includes bug fixes only, apart from a minor addition concerning
lexicographic ordering of vectors, which was not substantial enough for a
minor version bump. The changelog is below.

### Added

 - `igraph_vector_lex_cmp()` and `igraph_vector_colex_cmp()` for lexicographic
   and colexicographic comparison of vectors. These functions may also be used
   for sorting.

### Changed

 - `igraph_community_multilevel()` is now randomized (thanks to [Daniel Noom](https://github.com/GroteGnoom/)).

### Fixed

 - CMake settings that controlled the library installation directory name, such as `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, were not respected.
 - Under some conditions, the generated pkg-config file contained an incorrect include directory path.
 - The following functions were not exported from the shared library: `igraph_subcomponent()`, `igraph_stack_ptr_free_all()`, `igraph_stack_ptr_destroy_all()`, `igraph_status_handler_stderr()`, `igraph_progress_handler_stderr()`.
 - Built-in random number generators (`igraph_rngtype_mt19937`, `igraph_rngtype_rand`, `igraph_rngtype_glibc2`) were not exported from the shared library.
 - `igraph_layout_graphopt()` no longer rounds the `spring_length` parameter to an integer.
 - `igraph_get_all_shortest_paths_dijkstra()` no longer modifies the `res` vector's item destructor.
 - `igraph_get_shortest_path_bellman_ford()` did not work correctly when calculating paths to all vertices.
 - `igraph_arpack_rnsolve()` checks its parameters more carefully.
 - `igraph_community_to_membership()` does not crash anymore when `csize` is requested but `membership` is not.
 - `igraph_citing_cited_type_game()`: fixed memory leaks (thanks to [Daniel Noom](https://github.com/GroteGnoom).
 - `igraph_transitivity_undirected()`, `igraph_transitivity_avglocal_undirected()` and `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` no longer trigger an assertion failure when used with the null graph.
 - `igraph_(personalized_)pagerank()` would return incorrect results for weighted multigraphs with fewer than 128 vertices when using `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_PRPACK`.
 - `igraph_diversity()` now checks its input more carefully, and throws an error when the input graph has multi-edges or is directed.
 - `igraph_shortest_paths_johnson()` would return incorrect results when the `to` argument differed from `from` (thanks to Daniel Noom).
 - `igraph_is_graphical()` would fail to set the result variable for certain special degree sequences in the undirected simple graph case.
 - Non-maximal clique finding functions would sometimes return incomplete results when finding more than 2147483647 (i.e. 2^31 - 1) cliques.
 - GLPK internal errors no longer crash igraph.
 - Fixed some potential memory leaks that could happen on error conditions or when certain functions were interrupted.
 - When testing a DLL build on Windows, the `PATH` was sometimes not set correctly, causing the tests to fail.
 - When compiling from the git repository (as opposed to the release tarball), the build would fail with recent versions of `bison` and `flex`.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.
 - Much faster documentation builds.
 - Allow using a pre-generated `arith.h` header for f2c when cross-compiling; see the Installation section of the documentation.
 - The `IGRAPH_ENABLE_LTO` build option now supports the `AUTO` value, which uses LTO only if the compiler supports it. Warning: CMake may not always be able to detect that LTO is not fully supported. Therefore, the default setting is `OFF`.
 - The following functions are now interruptible: `igraph_grg_game()`, `igraph_sbm_game()`, `igraph_barabasi_game()`, `igraph_barabasi_aging_game()`.
 - Functions that use GLPK, such as `igraph_feedback_arc_set()` and `igraph_community_optimal_modularity()` are now interruptible.
 - Add support for older versions of Clang that do not recognize the `-Wno-varargs` flag.

### Acknowledgments

 - Big thanks to [Daniel Noom](https://github.com/GroteGnoom/) for continuing to expand the test suite and discovering and fixing several bugs in the process!

  </div>
    
  Release 0.9.0 of igraph's C core has arrived, almost exactly one year after the
latest minor release, 0.8.0. This release brings several new features and
improvements, and also a complete switch from the old `autotools`-based build
system to a new one based on [CMake](https://cmake.org). This results in faster
build times and the opportunity to use alternative build tools instead of
`make`; in particular, igraph now support [`ninja`](https://ninja-build.org) and
can also make use of a locally installed [`ccache`](https://ccache.dev)
compiler cache for even faster builds.

We gratefully acknowledge support from [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com) for
the development of igraph. In addition, we would like to thank everyone who
reported issues, contributed features or fixes, or edited the documentation.
igraph is an open-source project run by volunteers. *As always, your
contributions are very welcome!*

Most people use igraph through its high-level interfaces for [R](https://igraph.org/r/),
[Python](https://igraph.org/python/) or [Mathematica](http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM).
A new release of the Python interface, based on 0.9.0, is expected to be
released in a few days. The R and Mathematica interfaces already include some
of the improvements, and will continue to integrate more.

  [C/igraph](https://igraph.org/c/) 0.8.5, the fifth bugfix release of the 0.8 series, has arrived.

The sources can be obtained from [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.8.5).

This release includes bug fixes only. The changelog is below.

### Changed

 - `igraph_write_graph_pajek()`: the function now always uses the platform-native line endings (CRLF on Windows, LF on Unix and macOS). Earlier versions tried to enforce Windows line endings, but this was error-prone, and since all recent versions of Pajek support both line endings, enforcing Windows line endings is not necessary any more.

### Fixed

 - Fixed several compilation issues with MINGW32/64, thanks to [@jannick0](https://github.com/jannick0/)
 - `igraph_layout_davidson_harel()` was not interruptible; now it is.
 - Added a missing memory cleanup call in `igraph_i_cattribute_combine_vertices()`.
 - Fixed a few memory leaks in test cases.

This release includes bug fixes and documentation improvements. The changelog is below.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_i_cattribute_combine_vertices()`: fixed invalid cleanup code that eventually filled up the "finally" stack when combining vertices with attributes extensively.
 - `igraph_hrg_sample()`: fixed incorrect function prototype
 - `igraph_is_posinf()` and `igraph_is_neginf()`: fixed incorrect result on platforms where the sign of the result of `isinf()` is not indicative of the sign of the input.
 - Fixed building with vendored LAPACK and external BLAS
 - Fixed building with XCode 12.2 on macOS

### Other

 - Documentation improvements
 - General code cleanup to reduce the number of compiler warnings

This release brings `python-igraph` up-to-date with igraph 0.8.3, and it also
contains bug fixes and performance improvements. This release will also be the
last one whose version number is deliberately in sync with the version number
of the C core. The changelog is below.

### Added

* `Graph.community_leiden()` now supports a negative number of iterations; it will keep on iterating until the algorithm reaches a stable partition.

* `Graph.Incidence()` now supports weighted graphs, thanks to [@PuneethaPai](https://github.com/PuneethaPai/)

* You can now create a `Graph` object from a `pandas` dataframe with `Graph.DataFrame`, thanks to [@iosonofabio](https://github.com/iosonofabio/)

* Added conversion to/from `networkx` and `graph-tool` with `Graph.{to,from}_{networkx,graph_tool}`, thanks to [@iosonofabio](https://github.com/iosonofabio/)

* `Graph.add_edges()` and `Graph.add_vertices()` now supports specifying attributes for the newly added vertices and edges, thanks to [@iosonofabio](https://github.com/iosonofabio/)

* Added `Graph.dfs()` and `Graph.dfsiter()`, thanks to [@iosonofabio](https://github.com/iosonofabio/)

* Added `Graph.bridges()` to get the bridges of a graph.

* Added `Graph.clear()` to remove all edges, vertices and graph attributes in a single call, thanks to [@iosonofabio](https://github.com/iosonofabio/)

### Changed

* Upgraded igraph C library to 0.8.3.

* Graph union and intersection now supports graphs with vertex names, thanks to [@iosonofabio](https://github.com/iosonofabio/)

* `Graph.delete_vertices(None)` and `Graph.delete_edges(None)` are now deprecated; use `Graph.delete_vertices()` and `Graph.delete_edges()` (without a positional argument) instead to delete all vertices or edges. The old syntax will be removed in 0.9.

### Fixed

* `setup.py` now works on Windows with MinGW, thanks to [@Parakoopa](https://github.com/Parakoopa/)

* `Graph.difference()` now treats loop edges correctly

* `summary()` does not fail with non-string vertex names any more, thanks to [@deeenes](https://github.com/deeenes/)

* The Reingold-Tilford layout should not produce edge crossings on tree graphs any more.

* The postprocessing step of `Graph.biconnected_components()` is much faster now (#281); the earlier version was responsible for a significant speed difference between the C core and the Python interface.

### Other

* Various documentation improvements, thanks to [@chrisfalter](https://github.com/chrisfalter/), [@iosonofabio](https://github.com/iosonofabio/), [@kmankinen](https://github.com/kmankinen/), [@remysucre](https://github.com/remysucre/), [@szhorvat](https://github.com/szhorvat/)

* `Graph.complementer()` now allows keyword arguments (it used to support positional arguments only).

* Dropped support for Python 3.5, added support for Python 3.9.

The sources can be obtained from [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.8.3).

This release includes bug fixes and performance improvements. The changelog is below.

### Added

 - `igraph_vector_binsearch_slice()` performs binary search on a sorted slice of a vector.

### Changed

 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()` assumes the adjacency matrix of undirected graphs to have twice the number of self-loops for each vertex on the diagonal. This makes the results consistent between an undirected graph and its directed equivalent when each edge is replaced by a mutual edge pair.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_isomorphic()` now verifies that the input graphs have no multi-edges.
 - `igraph_difference()` was creating superfluous self loops.
 - `igraph_count_multiple()` was giving incorrect results for self-loops in directed graph.
 - `igraph_betweenness_estimate()`: fixed incorrect results with finite cutoff.
 - `igraph_eigen_matrix_symmetric()`: fixed incorrect matrix multiplication.
 - Corrected several issues that could arise during an error condition.
 - `igraph_realize_degree_sequence()` did not correctly detect some non-graphical inputs.
 - `igraph_is_graphical_degree_sequence()`: fixed incorrect results in undirected case.
 - `igraph_community_leiden()`: fixed incorrect result when self-loops are present.
 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()`: fixed incorrect value for isolated vertices in weighted graphs.
 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()`: corrected the handling of self-loops.
 - `igraph_layout_reingold_tilford()`: fixed an issue where branches of the tree would sometimes overlap. 

### Other

 - `igraph_degree_sequence_game()`: improved performance with `IGRAPH_DEGSEQ_SIMPLE_NO_MULTIPLE_UNIFORM` method.
 - Improved the robustness of the test suite.
 - Documentation improvements.
 - Improved error and warning messages.
 - Improved compatibility with recent versions of Microsoft Visual C.

    <div class="post-authors text-muted">The igraph Team</div>
  </div>
    
  We are excited to announce that the igraph project will be [supported](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/) with a grant of $180,000 from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in the [Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/) program. It was recognized that igraph fulfills a critical role for providing network analysis in a variety of scientific domains, including biomedical research. The funding will expedite ongoing development efforts, and should result in a 1.0 release of igraphâ€™s C core with a stable, well-documented and supported API.

For years, the development of igraph was done on a voluntary basis. With funding available, we can make sure developers have more time available to dedicate to igraph. In particular, the funding will support [GÃ¡bor CsÃ¡rdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi), [TamÃ¡s Nepusz](https://github.com/ntamas), [Szabolcs HorvÃ¡t](http://szhorvat.net/), [Vincent Traag](https://www.traag.net/) and [Fabio Zanini](http://fabilab.org/).

The core of igraph is written in C, but most people use igraph through its high-level interfaces for R, Python or Mathematica. Much of the development effort will be concentrated on the core of igraph, but the high-level interfaces will not be overlooked. 

Even though we will dedicate more time to igraph, the project cannot survive without a vibrant community of users and contributors. Whether you reported issues, contributed code or improved the documentation, your contributions remain vital to the project. We hope that our new [community forum](https://igraph.discourse.group/) will enable us to form a tighter and more supportive community, where you can ask questions, support others, or discuss recent advances in network analysis or graph theory.

The project will start from the 1st of September onwards, and will last for a year. The 1.0 version is planned to be released towards the end of the project.

  Release 0.8.0 of igraph's Python interface follows the recent release of
version 0.8.0 of the C core with many bug fixes that have accumulated over the
last five years, and an improved build process that does not require the C core
of igraph to be downloaded at the time when `python-igraph` is installed; the
tarball of `python-igraph` already bundles the appropriate version of the
C core in it.

Including the C core directly in the source tarball also allows us to decouple
python-igraph's version number from the version number of the C core in the
future. This means that we no longer have to wait for a release of the C core
in order to fix some bugs in the Python interface.

Precompiled Python wheels
-------------------------

Starting from this release, we will also aim to provide pre-compiled Python
wheels for most platforms. The current release includes Python wheels for
Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 on Windows, macOS and Linux, so most users will
not have to compile anything when installing `python-igraph` from pip.
Currently the only limitation is that the Windows wheels do not support GraphML
import; this will be fixed in the next patch release (0.8.1).

End of support for Python 2.7
-----------------------------

`python-igraph` 0.8.x will also be the _last_ version that supports Python 2.7.
Since Python 2 has [reached its end of life](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/),
we will drop support for Python 2 before `python-igraph` 0.9 so we can simplify
some parts of the codebase where we needed to introduce additional code to
support both Python versions.

As for Python 3, we are committing ourselves to supporting _at least_ the last
three minor releases of Python 3.

Although we are not supporting PyPy officially, `python-igraph` will also be
tested with PyPy regularly in a CI environment, and we will strive to fix any
issues that arise with PyPy. If you use `python-igraph` with PyPy and you are
willing to become an official maintainer responsible for PyPy compatibility,
please let us know in the [community forum](https://igraph.discourse.group/).

New community forum
-------------------

Concurrently with the release of igraph 0.8, we have launched [a new community
forum](https://igraph.discourse.group/), which replaces the mailing list as
the main support channel. The community forum is also meant for users of
`python-igraph`, so If you are a current `python-igraph` user or just
interested in the project, please join!

We would like to thank everyone who reported issues, contributed features or
fixes, or edited the documentation. igraph is an open-source project run by
volunteers. *As always, your contributions are very welcome!*

make it easier to use, with short and easy to remember, consistent
function names. Unfortunately this also means that many functions
have new names now, but don't worry, all the old names still work.

Apart from the new names, the biggest change in this release is
that most functions that used to return numeric vertex or edge ids,
return vertex/edge sequences now. This requires some time to get used
to and if you want the numeric ids instead, just use the `as.vector()`
function on the vertex/edge sequences.

We will update the documentation on this site, once the package
is on CRAN and available for all architectures.<p><a href="/2015/06/24/igraph-1.0.0-r.html">More &#8594;</a></p>

  A couple of days ago we changed how we use GitHub for igraph
development. Our goal is to make igraph development more accessible, and
our build process simpler. Instead of using a common repository for
everything, we now use separate repos for the igraph C library, the R
package and the Python extension. The igraph.org website was already in a
separate repository, and we will also break up the R package, by putting
loosely coupled parts in their own packages and repositories.

Main igraph repositories now:

 * igraph C library: https://github.com/igraph/igraph
 * igraph R package: https://github.com/igraph/rigraph
 * python-igraph: https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph
 * igraphdata R package: https://github.com/igraph/igraphdata
 * igraph.org homepage: https://github.com/igraph/igraph.org

  Release Notes
-------------

Some bug fixes, to make sure that the code included in
'Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R' works. See
https://github.com/kolaczyk/sand

Detailed changes:

- Graph drawing: fix labels of curved edges, issue #181.
- Graph drawing: allow fixing edge labels at given positions,
  issue #181.
- Drop the 'type' vertex attribute after bipartite projection,
  the projections are not bipartite any more, issue #255.
- Print logical attributes in header properly (i.e. encoded by `l`,
  not `x`,  which is for complex attributes. Issue #578.
- Add a constructor for `communities` objects, see `create.communities()`.
  Issue #547.
- Better error handling in the GraphML parser.
- GraphML reader is a bit more lenient now; makes it possible to read
  GraphML files saved from yWorks apps.
- Fixed a bug in `constaint()`, issue #580.
- Bipartite projection now detects invalid edges instead of giving
  a cryptic error, issue #543.
- Fixed the `simplify` argument of `graph.formula()`, which was
  broken, issue #586.
- The function `crossing()` adds better names to the result,
  fixes issue #587.
- The `sir()` function gives an error if the input graph is
  not simple, fixes issue #582.
- Calling igraph functions from igraph callbacks is not allowed now,
  fixes issue #571.

  R/igraph 0.4.4
==============

October 3, 2007

This release should work seemlessly with the new R 2.6.0 version.
Some other bugs were also fixed:

- A bug was fixed in the Erdos-Renyi graph generator, which sometimes
  added an extra vertex.
- MSVC compilation issues were fixed.
- MinGW compilation fixes.

August 13, 2007

The next one in the sequence of bugfix releases. Thanks to many people
sending bug reports. Here are the changes:

- Some memory leaks removed when using attributes from R or Python.
- GraphML parser: entities and character data in multiple chunks are now handled correctly.
- A bug corrected in edge betweenness community structure detection,
  it failed if called many times from the same program/session.
- Bug corrected in 'adjacent edges' edge iterator.
- Edge betweeness community structure: handle unconnected graphs properly.
- Fixed bug related to fast greedy community detection in unconnected graphs.
- Use a different kind of parser (Push) for reading GraphML files. This is almost
  invisible for users but fixed a nondeterministic bug when reading in GraphML
  files.
- R interface: plot now handles properly if called with a vector as the edge.width
  argument for directed graphs.
- R interface: bug (typo) corrected for walktrap.community and weighted graphs.
- Test suite should run correctly on Cygwin now.

This is another bugfix release, as there was a serious bug in the 
R package of the previous version: it could not read and write graphs
to files in any format under MS Windows.

Some other bits added:

- circular Reingold-Tilford layout generator for trees
- corrected a bug, Pajek files are written properly under MS Windows now.
- `arrow.size` graphical edge parameter added in the R interface.

  R/igraph 0.2
============

August 18, 2006

Release time at last! There are many new things in igraph 0.2, the
most important ones:

- reading writing Pajek and GraphML formats with attributes
  (not all Pajek and GraphML files are supported, see documentation
  for details)
- iterators totally rewritten, it is much faster and cleaner now
- the RANDEDU fast motif search algorithm is implemented
- many new graph generators, both games and regular graphs
- many new structural properties: transitivity, reciprocity, etc.
- graph operators: union, intersection, difference, structural holes, etc.
- conversion between directed and undirected graphs
- new layout algorithms for trees and large graphs, 3D layouts

and many more.

New things in the R package:

- support for CTRL+C
- new functions: Graph Laplacian, Burt's constraint, etc.
- vertex/edge sequences totally rewritten, smart indexing (see manual)
- new R manual and tutorial: 'Network Analysis with igraph', still 
  under development but useful
- very basic 3D plotting using OpenGL

Although this release was somewhat tested on Linux, MS Windows, Mac
OSX, Solaris 8 and FreeBSD, no heavy testing was done, so it might
contain bugs, and we kindly ask you to send bug reports to make igraph
better.
