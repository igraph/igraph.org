  <p>A new maintenance release of <a href="http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM">IGraph/M</a> is now available. This is a bugfix release recommended for all users. As usual, the simplest way to upgrade is to evaluate the following, and then restart Mathematica:</p>

</ul>

<p>Fixed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In rare cases, vertex names that were lists of other vertex names in the same graph were misinterpreted. This affected only Mathematica 12.0 and later.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IGCommunitiesLeadingEigenvector</code> is less likely to fail to converge now.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IGCommunitiesLeadingEigenvector</code> now respects random seeds set in Mathematica. These affect only the random starting vector it uses internally, which can very rarely cause non-deterministic output.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IGBarabasiAlbertGame</code> no longer accepts negative or zero exponents, as these were not handled correctly.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IGBridges</code> is no longer prone to stack overflow when given very large graphs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance improvements for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IGGraphEditor</code>.</li>
  <li>Documentation improvements.</li>

  <p><a href="https://igraph.org/c/">C/igraph</a> 0.10.0, the first release of the 0.10 series, has arrived.</p>

<p>The source can be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.10.0">the GitHub releases
page</a>.</p>

<p>This release focuses on infrastructural improvements, stability, and making the
igraph interface more consistent, more predictable and easier to use. It
contains many API-breaking changes and function renamings, in preparation for
a future 1.0 release, at which point the API will become stable. Changes in
this direction are likely to continue through a 0.11 release. It is recommended
that you migrate your code from 0.9 to 0.10 soon, to make the eventual
transition to 1.0 easier.</p>

follow soon with <em>lots</em> of breaking changes as we clean up the API in
preparation for a future 1.0 release.</p>

<p>If you have a project that currently relies on igraph 0.9, it is advised that
you update the project to use 0.9.10 and then start adapting it as soon as
possible to support 0.10.0 once it is released.</p>

  <p>igraph 0.10.0-rc.2, the second release candidate of igraph 0.10.0 is now available for download.

<p>Since this version is a release candidate only, it is meant primarily for developers who are working on a project that depends on the igraph library and who want to be prepared in advance for the upcoming changes in igraph 0.10.0. There is no official tarball on the igraph.org homepage as the latest stable version is still 0.9.9 - you need to get the tarball from the <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.10.0-rc.2">Github releases page</a> instead.

  <p>Our efforts to bring the R interface of igraph closer to the recent
developments of the C core continues: we have released
<a href="https://igraph.org/r/">R-igraph</a> 1.3.0, which updates the C core of igraph
within the R interface to version 0.9.7, which is now only one patch version
behind the mainline C core. The update fixes lots of bugs compared to the
previous release and adds quite a few new functions.</p>

<p>Due to the underlying changes in the C core of igraph between the 0.8 series
and 0.9.7, there are some cases when we needed to make extra efforts in the
R interface to keep things compatible with previous releases. For instance,
igraph 0.9.7 now interprets zero cutoff in the closeness, betweenness and edge
betweenness centrality functions literally, while igraph 0.8 interpreted zero
as “no cutoff”. The R interface keeps the old behaviour in such cases but
prints a deprecation warning; the old behaviour will be gone in igraph 1.4.0 or
2.0.0, whichever comes first.</p>

<p>A patch release of R/igraph is coming soon in the next few days, which will
hopefully (finally) catch up with the 0.9 branch of the C core. We aim to let
R/igraph stabilize for a few weeks now while we work on further improvements in
the C core.</p>

<p>Even though we tried to do our best not to cause breaking changes for users of
igraph from R, we may have made unintentional mistakes, so please keep on

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">igraph_rewire_directed_edges()</code> now generates multigraphs when edge

    <p>Fixed a bug in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IGRAPH_TO_UNDIRECTED_COLLAPSE</code> mode of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">igraph_to_undirected()</code> that provided an incorrect merge vector to the

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed the behaviour of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IGRAPH_ENABLE_LTO</code> option when it was set to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AUTO</code>; earlier versions had a bug where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AUTO</code> simply checked whether LTO

    <p>When using igraph from a CMake project, it is now checked that the project
has the C++ language enabled. This is necessary for linking to igraph with
CMake.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Improved the root selection method for disconnected graphs in the
Reingold-Tilford layout (#1836). The new root selection method provides
niceer results if the graph is not a tree, although it is still recommended
to use the Sugiyama layout instead, unless the input graph is <em>almost</em>
a tree, in which case Reingold-Tilfold may still be preferred.</p>

    <a href="/2021/09/01/funding.html">Additional funding for igraph</a></h1>
  </div>
    
  <p>The igraph project is proud to announce that the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a> continues to fund the project in their program on <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/">Essential Open Source Software for Science</a>. The project will receive two grants of $400,000 over the course of the next two years. One grant will help to further develop and maintain the igraph project. The other grant will help to diversify the pool of contributors and maintainers of the project, which is jointly coordinated with <a href="https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/wins">Women in Network Science</a>, and will be led by <a href="https://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/">Brooke Foucault Welles</a>.</p>

<p>Last year, the core library of igraph was enormously improved, making the library easier to build, easier to maintain and easier to use. However, most users are not using the C core directly, but are using it through one of the interfaces: Python, R or Mathematica. The CZI grant will support the igraph development team on improving these interfaces, by making them more intuitive to use and by integrating them more closely in the host language. Additionally, development efforts will be aimed at making the library and the interfaces easier to maintain, focusing on long-term sustainability. This ensures that igraph continues to be a useful tool for network scientists from various disciplines across the globe.</p>

<p>Having people committed to maintain and further develop igraph is critical to ensure its long-term viability. We made steps towards building a more inclusive and engaged community by opening a <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group">forum</a> dedicated to igraph. We aim to enlarge and diversify the team of contributors and maintainers of the project. Making it easier to start using igraph and contributing to igraph is an important step. Improving documentation and tutorials helps achieve that goal, but we will also actively organize workshops for users and contributors, with a specific focus on women and non-binary people, and engage more actively on the community forum. Additionally, a mentorship programme will be setup specifically to facilitate women and non-binary people to use and contribute to igraph, paving the way for them to become maintainers of igraph. The CZI grant will enable us to engage more people in achieving these objectives.</p>

  <p>Release 0.9.0 of igraph’s C core has arrived, almost exactly one year after the
latest minor release, 0.8.0. This release brings several new features and
improvements, and also a complete switch from the old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autotools</code>-based build
system to a new one based on <a href="https://cmake.org">CMake</a>. This results in faster
build times and the opportunity to use alternative build tools instead of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code>; in particular, igraph now support <a href="https://ninja-build.org"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ninja</code></a> and
can also make use of a locally installed <a href="https://ccache.dev"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ccache</code></a>
compiler cache for even faster builds.</p>

<p>We gratefully acknowledge support from <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com">CZI</a> for
the development of igraph. In addition, we would like to thank everyone who
reported issues, contributed features or fixes, or edited the documentation.
igraph is an open-source project run by volunteers. <em>As always, your
contributions are very welcome!</em></p>

<p>Most people use igraph through its high-level interfaces for <a href="https://igraph.org/r/">R</a>,
<a href="https://igraph.org/python/">Python</a> or <a href="http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM">Mathematica</a>.
A new release of the Python interface, based on 0.9.0, is expected to be
released in a few days. The R and Mathematica interfaces already include some
of the improvements, and will continue to integrate more.</p>

    <a href="/2020/05/27/funding.html">Funding from CZI</a></h1>
  </div>
    
  <p>We are excited to announce that the igraph project will be <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/">supported</a> with a grant of $180,000 from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/">Essential Open Source Software for Science</a> program. It was recognized that igraph fulfills a critical role for providing network analysis in a variety of scientific domains, including biomedical research. The funding will expedite ongoing development efforts, and should result in a 1.0 release of igraph’s C core with a stable, well-documented and supported API.</p>

<p>For years, the development of igraph was done on a voluntary basis. With funding available, we can make sure developers have more time available to dedicate to igraph. In particular, the funding will support <a href="https://github.com/gaborcsardi">Gábor Csárdi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ntamas">Tamás Nepusz</a>, <a href="http://szhorvat.net/">Szabolcs Horvát</a>, <a href="https://www.traag.net/">Vincent Traag</a> and <a href="http://fabilab.org/">Fabio Zanini</a>.</p>

<p>The core of igraph is written in C, but most people use igraph through its high-level interfaces for R, Python or Mathematica. Much of the development effort will be concentrated on the core of igraph, but the high-level interfaces will not be overlooked.</p>

<p>Even though we will dedicate more time to igraph, the project cannot survive without a vibrant community of users and contributors. Whether you reported issues, contributed code or improved the documentation, your contributions remain vital to the project. We hope that our new <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group/">community forum</a> will enable us to form a tighter and more supportive community, where you can ask questions, support others, or discuss recent advances in network analysis or graph theory.</p>

<p>The project will start from the 1st of September onwards, and will last for a year. The 1.0 version is planned to be released towards the end of the project.</p>

  <p>Release 0.8.0 of igraph’s Python interface follows the recent release of
version 0.8.0 of the C core with many bug fixes that have accumulated over the
last five years, and an improved build process that does not require the C core
of igraph to be downloaded at the time when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-igraph</code> is installed; the
tarball of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-igraph</code> already bundles the appropriate version of the
C core in it.</p>

<p>Including the C core directly in the source tarball also allows us to decouple
python-igraph’s version number from the version number of the C core in the
future. This means that we no longer have to wait for a release of the C core
in order to fix some bugs in the Python interface.</p>

<h2 id="precompiled-python-wheels">Precompiled Python wheels</h2>

<p>Starting from this release, we will also aim to provide pre-compiled Python
wheels for most platforms. The current release includes Python wheels for
Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 on Windows, macOS and Linux, so most users will
not have to compile anything when installing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-igraph</code> from pip.
Currently the only limitation is that the Windows wheels do not support GraphML
import; this will be fixed in the next patch release (0.8.1).</p>

<h2 id="end-of-support-for-python-27">End of support for Python 2.7</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-igraph</code> 0.8.x will also be the <em>last</em> version that supports Python 2.7.
Since Python 2 has <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">reached its end of life</a>,
we will drop support for Python 2 before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-igraph</code> 0.9 so we can simplify
some parts of the codebase where we needed to introduce additional code to
support both Python versions.</p>

<p>As for Python 3, we are committing ourselves to supporting <em>at least</em> the last
three minor releases of Python 3.</p>

<p>Although we are not suporting PyPy officially, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-igraph</code> will also be
tested with PyPy regularly in a CI environment, and we will strive to fix any
issues that arise with PyPy. If you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-igraph</code> with PyPy and you are
willing to become an official maintainer responsible for PyPy compatibility,
please let us know in the <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group/">community forum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-community-forum">New community forum</h2>

<p>Concurrently with the release of igraph 0.8, we have launched <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group/">a new community
forum</a>, which replaces the mailing list as
the main support channel. The community forum is also meant for users of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-igraph</code>, so If you are a current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python-igraph</code> user or just
interested in the project, please join!</p>

  <h2 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h2>

<p>This is a new major release, with a lot of UI changes. We tried to
make it easier to use, with short and easy to remember, consistent
function names. Unfortunately this also means that many functions
have new names now, but don’t worry, all the old names still work.</p>

<p>Apart from the new names, the biggest change in this release is
that most functions that used to return numeric vertex or edge ids,
return vertex/edge sequences now. This requires some time to get used
to and if you want the numeric ids instead, just use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as.vector()</code>
function on the vertex/edge sequences.</p>

<p>We will update the documentation on this site, once the package
is on CRAN and available for all architectures.</p><p><a href="/2015/06/24/igraph-1.0.0-r.html">More &#8594;</a></p>

  <p>A couple of days ago we changed how we use GitHub for igraph
development. Our goal is to make igraph development more accessible, and
our build process simpler. Instead of using a common repository for
everything, we now use separate repos for the igraph C library, the R
package and the Python extension. The igraph.org website was already in a
separate repository, and we will also break up the R package, by putting
loosely coupled parts in their own packages and repositories.</p>

<p>Main igraph repositories now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>igraph C library: https://github.com/igraph/igraph</li>
  <li>igraph R package: https://github.com/igraph/rigraph</li>
  <li>python-igraph: https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph</li>

<p>August 13, 2007</p>

<p>The next one in the sequence of bugfix releases. Thanks to many people
sending bug reports. Here are the changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some memory leaks removed when using attributes from R or Python.</li>
  <li>GraphML parser: entities and character data in multiple chunks are now handled correctly.</li>
  <li>A bug corrected in edge betweenness community structure detection,
it failed if called many times from the same program/session.</li>
  <li>Bug corrected in ‘adjacent edges’ edge iterator.</li>
  <li>Edge betweeness community structure: handle unconnected graphs properly.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug related to fast greedy community detection in unconnected graphs.</li>
  <li>Use a different kind of parser (Push) for reading GraphML files. This is almost
invisible for users but fixed a nondeterministic bug when reading in GraphML
files.</li>
  <li>R interface: plot now handles properly if called with a vector as the edge.width
argument for directed graphs.</li>
  <li>R interface: bug (typo) corrected for walktrap.community and weighted graphs.</li>
  <li>Test suite should run correctly on Cygwin now.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>reading writing Pajek and GraphML formats with attributes
(not all Pajek and GraphML files are supported, see documentation
for details)</li>
  <li>iterators totally rewritten, it is much faster and cleaner now</li>
  <li>the RANDEDU fast motif search algorithm is implemented</li>
  <li>many new graph generators, both games and regular graphs</li>
  <li>many new structural properties: transitivity, reciprocity, etc.</li>
  <li>graph operators: union, intersection, difference, structural holes, etc.</li>
  <li>conversion between directed and undirected graphs</li>
  <li>new layout algorithms for trees and large graphs, 3D layouts</li>
</ul>

<p>and many more.</p>

<p>New things in the R package:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support for CTRL+C</li>
  <li>new functions: Graph Laplacian, Burt’s constraint, etc.</li>
  <li>vertex/edge sequences totally rewritten, smart indexing (see manual)</li>
  <li>new R manual and tutorial: ‘Network Analysis with igraph’, still 
under development but useful</li>
  <li>very basic 3D plotting using OpenGL</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this release was somewhat tested on Linux, MS Windows, Mac
OSX, Solaris 8 and FreeBSD, no heavy testing was done, so it might
contain bugs, and we kindly ask you to send bug reports to make igraph
